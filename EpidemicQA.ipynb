              "'BACKGROUND: Percutaneous tracheostomy (PT) in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) included several critical steps associated with increased risk of aerosol generation. We reported a modified PT technique aiming to minimize the risk of aerosol generation and to increase the staff safety in COVID‐19 patients. METHODS: PT was performed with a modified technique including the use of a smaller endotracheal tube (ETT) cuffed at the carina during the procedure. RESULTS: The modified technique we proposed was successfully performed in three critically ill patients with COVID‐19. CONCLUSIONS: In COVID‐19 critically ill patients, a modified PT technique, including the use of a smaller ETT cuffed at the carina and fiber‐optic bronchoscope inserted between the tube and the inner surface of the trachea, may ensure a better airway management, respiratory function, patient comfort, and great safety for the staff. As the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) globally spreads, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is straining health care workers worldwide. 1 In hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, endotracheal intubation is one of the most common and indispensable life-saving interventions. In a recent report from the city of New York, 12% of COVID-19 patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. 2 Since difficult weaning and prolonged mechanical ventilation represent the two most common indications for tracheostomy in intensive care unit (ICU), it may play a central role in COVID-19 management. 3 During the 2019-nCov pandemic, the aerosol generating procedures, such as tracheostomy, expose physicians at high risk to contract the infection. 4 Accordingly, special consideration may be done to protect otolaryngologists, general surgeons, and critical care physicians from the risk of infection while performing a tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients. 5 Percutaneous tracheostomy (PT) is routinely performed at the bedside in ICU; unfortunately, a modified protocol to perform PT in COVID-19 patients included several critical steps associated with increased risk of aerosol generation, such as changing the catheter mount, repositioning the endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff to the level of the vocal cords, and removal of large dilator. 6 So far, there has been no prior description in the literature of how to minimize the aerosol generation during PT. We reported a modified PT technique aiming to minimize the risk of aerosol generation and to increase the staff safety in COVID-19 patients. We performed three PTs at ICU bedside because of three COVID-19 patients were difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation. Patients were aged 47, 67, and 71 years old (one woman and two men) and all reported positive after nasopharyngeal swabs. Since the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, from the 10th of March, our ICU was completely dedicated to COVID-19 patients. The rooms had no negative pressure inside. As follow we reported the procedural steps of PT performed with a guidewire forceps technique. The readers are encouraged to watch the supplementary video (Video S1) for a more comprehensive understanding of the procedure. • The tracheostomy team was formed by two expert ICU physicians in airway procedures and a nurse. • All personnel were equipped with the proper personal protective equipment, including an N99 mask, eye goggles, transparent full-face shield, gown, and double gloves. • Before the procedure, patients were anesthetized with midazolam 0.3 to 0.35 mg/kg, fentanyl 0.1 mg, and cisatracurium 0.2 mg/kg. • Before the beginning of the procedures, volume control ventilation was set at a respiratory rate of 15 breaths/min with an FiO 2 of 1.0, tidal volume of 500 mL, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H 2 O. • After 5 minutes of preoxygenation with the previous ventilation settings, the ventilator was switched off by the nurse. The ICU physician replaced the ETT in place with a smaller ETT with an internal diameter of 6 mm by using a videolaryngoscope. • The ETT was cuffed at the level of the carina (Figure 1 ). Then the ventilator was connected with the ETT and switched on. • By using the videolaryngosocpe to visualize the glottis, the fiber-optic bronchoscope with an external diameter of 5 mm was passed through the vocal cords. • The fiber-optic bronchoscope was removed after the removal of the ETT. To our knowledge, our was the first report describing a modified PT procedure targeted to COVID-19 critically ill patients. Ensuring minimal exposure and risk to the staff that perform the procedures was of paramount importance. 7 Takhar et al proposed a modified PT technique in COVID-19 6 : this technique differed from the standard one for (a) the clamping of the ETT and pausing the ventilator while positioning the cuff at the level of the vocal cords, (b) pausing the ventilator again while removing the dilator from the trachea, and 3) for covering the tracheal puncture site with gauze. 6 In our opinion, changing catheter mount for bronchoscopy, repositioning ETT cuff to the level of the vocal cords, and removal of large rhino dilator were three steps associated with an increased risk of aerosol generation. 6 In the modified procedure proposed by our team, only the exchanging of the ETT with a smaller one might increase the risk of aerosol generation. However, our expertise in airway management allowed us to perform this step by using the videolaryngoscope as recommended by a recent guideline. 8 Indeed, using a videolaryngoscope with a separate screen enables the operator to stay further away from the airway; this technique is recommended only for those physicians trained in their use. 8 Having the cannula, the ETT and fiber-optic bronchoscope inside the trachea while removing the smaller ETT at the end of the procedure may limit the aerosol spread at this step. Our previous experience demonstrated that the ETT, the tracheal cannula, and the fiber-optic bronchoscope can be simultaneously inserted inside the trachea. 9 Our modified PT technique was performed with ETT cuffed at the level of the carina and the fiber-optic bronchoscope outside it; this allowed a stable gas exchange, airway pressure, ventilation, and no spread of aerosol during the procedure. 8 In COVID-19 critically ill patients, a modified PT technique, including the use of a smaller ETT cuffed at the carina and fiber-optic bronchoscope inserted between the tube and the inner surface of the trachea, just below the vocal cords, may ensure a better airway management, respiratory function, patient comfort, and great safety for the staff.'"

              "[\"The emergence of the highly pathogenic SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has reignited interest in coronavirus biology and pathogenesis. An emerging theme in coronavirus pathogenesis is that the interaction between specific viral genes and the host immune system, specifically the innate immune system, functions as a key determinant in regulating virulence and disease outcomes. Using SARS-CoV as a model, we will review the current knowledge of the interplay between coronavirus infection and the host innate immune system in vivo, and then discuss the mechanisms by which specific gene products antagonize the host innate immune response in cell culture models. Our data suggests that the SARS-CoV uses specific strategies to evade and antagonize the sensing and signaling arms of the interferon pathway. We summarize by identifying future points of consideration that will contribute greatly to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing coronavirus pathogenesis and virulence, and the development of severe disease in humans and animals. Viral interactions with the innate immune system play a central role in determining the outcome of infection. Early control of viral replication by type I interferons (IFN), complement proteins, and other innate immune mediators limit viral spread within the host during the early phases of the disease (Katze et al., 2002) . The early innate response also plays an important role in shaping the downstream adaptive immune response, however an overactive innate immune response can also result in immune pathology and subsequent tissue damage (reviewed in Garcia-Sastre and Biron, 2006) . Within the last decade, it is clear that many viruses encode specific gene products that antagonize both the innate and acquired arms of the immune response (Andrejeva et al., 2004; Basler et al., 2000; Cruz et al., 2006; Gale et al., 1997; Meylan et al., 2005; Parisien et al., 2001; Park et al., 2003; Symons et al., 1995; Xiang et al., 2002; Ye et al., 2007) . Therefore, a detailed knowledge of how specific viruses interact with the host innate immune system is essential for understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating virulence, pathogenesis and disease outcomes. Coronavirus interactions with the adaptive immune system have been studied in great detail, however, surprisingly little is known about how these viruses interact with the innate immune system (La Bonnardiere and Laude, 1983) . Although early studies indicated that mutations in the M glycoprotein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) modulated type I IFN responses, suggesting that coronaviruses may encode a novel set of gene functions that interface with the host innate immune response, little effort focused on unraveling the details of coronavirus innate immune interactions (Charley and Laude, 1988; La Bonnardiere and Laude, 1983) . Early experiments showed that variants of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) are differentially susceptible to IFN. This may contribute to different pathogenic outcomes, however little additional experimentation was performed (Taguchi and Siddell, 1985) . The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic of 2003 rekindled a high level of interest in how coronaviruses interact with the host and whether interactions with the host innate immune system are important in both the control of viral infection or if these interactions lead to virus-induced disease. In this article, we will discuss two components of the innate immune response that are clearly important for SARS-CoV induced disease: (1) interactions with macrophages (MP) and dendritic cells (DC), which shape the early innate and adaptive immune responses within the lung, while also potentially contributing to virus-induced immune pathology, and (2) the type I IFN system, an essential component of the early innate response to viral infections that appears to be blocked or evaded by SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses. Dendritic cells and macrophages are first line components of the innate immune network. DCs, which can be grouped into plasmacytoid (pDC) and myeloid types (mDC), play important roles in driving both innate and adaptive immune responses to viral pathogens (Akira and Hemmi, 2003; Ito et al., 2005; Nakano et al., 2001) . pDCs rapidly respond to viruses or their derivatives to produce large amounts of type I IFN, which can induce direct antiviral responses and also modulate other components of the innate and adaptive immune response, such as natural killer cells and CD8 T cells (Colonna et al., 2004; Diebold et al., 2003; Cella et al., 1999; Siegal et al., 1999) . Though less robust than pDCs, mDCs can also secrete large amounts of type I IFN (Laiosa et al., 2006) . However, mDCs also play a major role in stimulating acquired immune responses through their capacity as antigen presenting cells and producers of a wide array of immuno-modulatory cytokines (Laiosa et al., 2006) . MPs are potent producers of type I IFNs and other pro-inflammatory cytokines that induce antiviral protection while also potentially contributing to immune pathology associated with viral infections (Diamond et al., 2003) . Analysis of the impact of DCs and MPs on SARS-CoV infection will be discussed below. Since its discovery 50 years ago by Isaacs and Lindemann, the IFN system has come to be recognized as a crucial frontline defense against viral infection (Isaacs and Lindenmann, 1957) . IFNs mediate direct antiviral effects that limit viral replication by activating/up-regulating several well defined antiviral effectors, including PKR and RNaseL, while also modulating other aspects of the innate and adaptive immune responses through the induction of a wide array of IFN inducible genes (ISGs) (Stark et al., 1998; Takaoka and Yanai, 2006) . The number of pathogens that neutralize IFN, or other key components of the IFN system, illustrate that this system is essential for the control of a diverse array of viruses and bacteria. Perhaps the clearest indicator of how important this pathway is to antivi- Fig. 1 . IFN sensing and signaling pathway. RNA viruses are internalized through several mechanisms, either fusion with the plasma membrane or binding to a surface receptor (ACE2 for SARS-CoV, carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) for MHV). That internalization exposes the genomic RNA to the dsRNA sensing machinery in the cell; TLR3, RIGI and MDA5. These proteins signal the IRF-3 cascade leading to induction of IFNb and production of secreted IFN␤ protein. That IFN␤ protein can then bind IFN␣/␤ receptors (INFAR1) on the surface of the same cell or surrounding cells. This activates the Stat1 signaling pathway to activate the many anti-viral genes found with ISRE promoter elements. ral defense is the sheer number of IFN avoidance/antagonism strategies that viruses have evolved. These viral IFN evasion strategies can be roughly segregated into three categories: (1) avoidance, where the virus shields itself or its byproducts from recognition by the host cell sensors that activate the IFN system (Cardenas et al., 2006) , (2) suppression of IFN induction, where the virus actively inhibits the host cell sensor machinery or its downstream signaling molecules to prevent the initiation of IFN transcription (Cardenas et al., 2006; Hiscott et al., 2006a, b; Lin et al., 2006; Li et al., 2005a, b; Meylan et al., 2005) , or (3) suppression of IFN signaling, where viral gene products block signaling events at or downstream of the type I IFN receptor complex to prevent activation of an antiviral state within the infected cell or the enhancement of the IFN response by activating late type I IFN genes (Parisien et al., 2001; Rodriguez et al., 2002) . This raises the question of how coronaviruses, which include human (SARS-CoV, NL63, OC43 and 229E) and animal (MHV, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, TGEV, etc.) strains, interact with the type I IFN system. Of these viruses, only 229E has been shown to induce IFN in infected cells in culture, while viruses such as SARS-CoV and MHV fail to induce type I IFN responses in cell culture. However, the mechanism for how coronaviruses evade the innate immune system is largely unexplored. There are two major pathways through which cells sense invading viruses and activate the IFN pathway (reviewed in Sen, 2001) . Toll like receptors (TLRs), which include TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9, can detect viruses in endosomal compartments as they enter cells, while cytoplasmic CARD domain containing RNA helicases, RIG-I and Mda5, sense viral RNA in the cytoplasm. Both pathways are based on sensor interactions with pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as double stranded RNA which is a byproduct of viral replication, or structured single stranded RNAs associated with incoming viral genomes, being common targets. The TLR and cytoplasmic IFN induction pathways do utilize different adaptor proteins to mediate signaling, with the TLR dependent pathways utilizing TRIF and/or MyD88, and the cytoplasmic induction pathway utilizing the mitochondrial adaptor protein MAVS/IPS-1/VISA/CARDIF (Fig. 1) . Downstream of the differing adapters, both pathways share many common signaling molecules and transcription factors, with both pathways ultimately activating IRF-3, NFB, and AP-1 to initiate type I IFN gene transcription. Each of these pathways will be discussed further with respect to its potential role in coronavirus infection (Table 1) . The human impact of the SARS-CoV epidemic in 2003 led to an intensive research effort to understand the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV induced disease. Much of this effort focused on interactions between the virus and immune response within the lung. This effort will be broken down into patient studies, which are informative, but by their very nature, complex, studies in animal models, and cell culture based analysis of viral interactions with primary cells or cell lines, which provide greater experimental control at the cost of potentially oversimplifying the system. Several groups analyzed the serum of SARS-CoV infected patients to determine which classes of cytokines were upregulated during infection Yu et al., 2005) . Zhang et al. found that IL-6 was up-regulated in serum while IL-8 and TGF-beta were decreased in SARS patients. They also found that IFN␥, IL-4 and IL-10 were increased only in convalescent SARS patients (Zhang et al., 2004) . Reghunathan et al. found that IP-10 was induced in SARS-CoV infected patients and there was a correlation between high IP-10 levels and poor patient outcome (Reghunathan et al., 2005) . The authors also found that IL-6, IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were highly induced in super-infected patients, with high levels indicative of a high risk of death. Additionally, microarray-based analysis of RNA derived from PBMCs from 10 SARS-CoV infected patients demonstrated that the cells were highly activated and expressing high levels of inflammatory cytokines. However, no IFN␣ or ␤ induction was detected in these patients. Though these studies provide valuable information on the kinetics and type of host cytokine response that occurs in infected humans during SARS-CoV infection, drawing general conclusions from these studies is difficult due to differences in both the timing of study, the patient population analyzed, and the types of assays used to evaluate cytokine responses. Several experiments were performed on lung tissue from fatal SARS cases. Most reports used only a single or a few patients with different times of death, whether it was from acute disease or a secondary infection, trying to compare their study to a control patient. Chen et al. identified carbon containing MPs while To et al. found only infection of epithelial cells by in situ and immunofluorescence . Another publication by Chow et al. identifies lung pneumocytes, but not MPs as the site of virus replication, while yet another identifies a different lymphocyte population as the main replication target (Chow et al., 2004) . Each of these differs in the type and length of time of infection of tissues used, the fixation technique for tissue preservation, the type of probe and the technique used to identify viral proteins and RNA. A recent paper by Nicholls et al. attempts to combine a large set of patient samples using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and RT-PCR to build a comprehensive picture of the infection cycle (Nicholls et al., 2006) . They also comment on how false positive or negatives can arise for several reasons, including: (1) not all lung tissue is homogenous, so using tissue from one part of the lung versus another can critically change your interpretation, (2) different probes and techniques have varying levels of sensitivity depending on the age of the tissue and how it was handled, (3) the age of the individual will alter the immune response and clearance time of infection, (4) the overall immune status of the individual at the time of infection (immuno-compromised versus healthy) would impact on both the overall levels of viral replication and the subsequent host inflammatory response to the virus, and (5) the timeframe from initial symptoms to death may differ significantly between individuals, with individuals that rapidly progress showing higher levels of virus at the time of death, while individuals that succumb to infection after an extended period may have little virus present and die due to secondary causes. Based on their analysis of this large set of patient samples, Nicholls et al., concluded that alveolar epithelium and MPs are the primary targets of SARS-CoV in the lung. They also suggest that pneumocytes may be the initial site of infection, but that MPs take up virions and disseminate the virus within the lungs. Interestingly, in the 25 patients they tested that died within 2 weeks of symptoms, no virus was detected by in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry, even in tissues with clear damage. This suggests that viral replication may not be directly responsible for death in these individuals, raising the possibility that virus-induced immune pathology may contribute to SARS-CoV induced disease. In fact, since high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines correlate with poor SARS-CoV outcome (Reghunathan et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2004) , it is possible that SARS-CoV infection of MPs or other potent producers of pro-inflammatory cytokines, without high levels of viral replication, may ultimately lead to virusinduced immune pathology within the lungs of patients with poor disease outcomes. Given their role in maintaining homeostasis within the lungs, as well as their ability to mount robust innate immune responses, it is important to consider the role of MPs and DCs during SARS-CoV infection. Several conflicting reports of SARS-CoV replication and IFN induction in MPs and DCs have been published over the last few years. Early reports showed that SARS-CoV did not replicate efficiently in purified monocytes and MPs (Yilla et al., 2005) . The infection however was donor dependent, with 100% infection in some donors and less than 5% infection efficiency in others. This study also showed that there was a correlation between the donor cells that produced high amounts of IFN␣ in response to SARS-CoV also being less permissive for produc-tive infection. However, this is not the case for all their donors, with some producing high levels of IFN and being infected while other produce low levels of IFN and were not infected. Castilletti et al. also found IFN␣ and ␥ induced from PBMCs infected with SARS-CoV, with the most robust responses occurring when the PBMCs were exposed to fixed SARS-CoV infected Vero cells (Castilletti et al., 2005) . These results suggest that PBMCs are poorly permissive for SARS-CoV and the authors propose that PBMCs may be able to detect viral glycoproteins on the surface of cells and that this may be a mechanism for the apparent immuno-pathology seen in SARS patients lungs. Results from Spiegel et al., also demonstrated that both live and UV inactivated SARS-CoV could induce type I IFN responses and cellular maturation in DC cultures , suggesting that productive viral replication is not required to active anti-viral and/or pro-inflammatory responses in these cells. Similarly, Law et al. find no replication in their isolated DCs but did find a different cytokine induction profile (Law et al., 2005) . The authors infected DCs with SARS-CoV and analyzed the effects on cell surface markers and maturation. By electron microscopy virions are seen inside both immature and mature DCs and small amounts of negative strand RNA were detectable in those cells, suggesting that some level of viral gene expression was occurring. However the level of RNA decreased over the course of several days indicating that there was no productive replication. These studies found no evidence of apoptosis or antiviral cytokines such as IFN␣, ␤, ␥ and IL-12; however, they did find significant up-regulation of IP-10, MIP1␣, Rantes and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). The differences in cytokine profiles between the Castilleti and Law studies may reflect infection of different cell types, however, both groups suggest that the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory chemokines may recruit monocytic cells to sites of infection and be a major cause of lung pathology in patients. Several other groups have also evaluated whether MPs and/or DCs are targets of SARS-CoV infection and whether this infection leads to production of pro-inflammatory cytokine responses that might contribute to virus-induced immune pathology within the lung. Tseng et al. characterized the effect of SARS-CoV infection on human MPs and DCs (Tseng et al., 2005) . They find that neither cell is permissive to SARS-CoV replication, which is consistent with the results described above, as well as studies by Ziegler et al. (2005) . In the studies by Tseng et al., the MPs and DCs were phenotypically altered after SARS-CoV exposure. They found no increase of cell death but exposure increases the production of IL-6 and IL-12 upon exposure to a suboptimal dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), indicating that SARS primes the cells to respond to TLR ligands, but did not directly activate the cells. They also demonstrated that SARS-CoV decreased the phagocytic activity of MPs to FITC-Dextran while at the same time increasing the ability of DCs to stimulate naïve T cells. Overall, these studies suggest that neither MPs nor DCs are highly permissive for SARS-CoV replication. While some groups did not see SARS-CoV associated inflammatory cytokine induction in MPs or DCs, the overall consensus from this work is that SARS-CoV infection can lead to either the direct activation or the priming of pro-inflammatory cytokine responses in Fig. 2 . Lack of an IFN beta induction by SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV was tested for its ability to activate an IFN beta promoter by transfection of 293T cells with a plasmid containing the IFN␤ promoter driving expression of firefly luciferase. After 24 h post transfection either PBS, SARS-CoV or Sendai Virus was added at an MOI of 5. Samples were taken at 8, 24, 36 and 48 h post infection and analyzed for luciferase production. We find no induction of IFN␤ resulting from SARS-CoV infection however a robust expression level is seen in the Sendai Virus infected cells. The depletion of luciferase seen in the Sendai infections after 24 h is due to cell death. these cell types, which may ultimately contribute to the development of virus-induced immune pathology within the lungs. The effect of viral infection on the induction of antiviral type I IFN responses in these cell types is less clear cut, since type I IFN induction has been observed by some groups and not others. This difference may reflect sensitivity differences in their assays, the cell types that are being evaluated, or even genetic differences in their donor cohorts. Therefore, further work is needed to determine whether or not SARS-CoV is an activator of antiviral responses in these cells. Type I IFN induction has been observed in some studies of SARS-CoV infected MPs and DCs (Castilletti et al., 2005) . These cell types are capable of mounting type I IFN responses in the absence of active viral replication, it is unclear whether cells that are productively infected with SARS-CoV can mount type I IFN responses, and by extension, whether SARS-CoV actively blocks type I IFN induction or signaling (Yen et al., 2006) . The cell line used for most virus growth experiments and protein analysis is VeroE6, which lacks a functional IFN␤ gene. Other cell lines have been used to identify the IFN pathways induced during SARS-CoV infection such as MA104 and Caco2 cells which are highly permissive for infection (>90% infected, yields ∼10 7 PFU/ml) and 293 cells which are semi-permissive at best (∼5-10% infected; yields of ∼10 4-5 PFU/ml). Several laboratories have been using these cell lines to identify which, if any, cytokines and chemokines are induced during infection. We have analyzed the type I IFN response in several cell lines. To investigate whether IFN␤ was induced by SARS-CoV infection we transfected 293T cells with a plasmid containing the IFN␤ promoter followed by luciferase. We found that IFN␤ promoter activity was not induced during the course of an infection, from as early as 6 h to 48 h post infection (Fig. 2) . During this time frame, Sendai Virus (SeV) infected cells induced large amounts of IFN␤ promoter activity. We also tested whether MA104 cells, African green monkey kidney cells that have an intact IFN system secrete IFN when infected with SARS-CoV. We find no Type I IFN to be secreted from either Urbani infected or Tor2 infected cells (Fig. 3) . As a control, PIV infected MA104 cells produced large amounts of Type I IFN over the course of the infection. Cinatl Jr. et al. compared intestinal cell lines Caco2 and CL-14 for their cytokine profile via microarray analysis (Cinatl et al., 2004) . They find the SARS-CoV replicates to very high titer, ∼10 8 TCID 50 /ml and infected cells show cytopathic effect (CPE) commensurate with virus titer. Microarray analysis was performed on cells at a single 24 h time point post infection. They find no change in IFN␣ and ␤ but an up-regulation of CXC chemokines, OAS2 and MX. Interestingly there was no difference in the double stranded RNA activated protein kinase (PKR). IL-18 and MP migration inhibitory factor (MIF) are down-regulated. They extend this correlation to data seen in some patient samples where they find an up-regulation of IP-10 and IL-8. Spiegel et al. also used Caco2 as well as 293 cells to characterize the innate immune response to SARS infection, comparing the effects of virus on permissive (Caco2) and less permissive cells (293T cells) . Although SARS-CoV infection did not induce IFNs, antiviral genes or IL-6; IP-10 and IL-8 were induced in the permissive Caco2 cells, but not 293 cells. They conclude that early virus growth is probably able to expand rapidly while suppressing anti-viral genes but still secreting IP-10 and IL-8 to recruit immune cells. Tang et al. used a human hepatoma cell line Huh7 for comparative infection of the coronaviruses SARS and 229E (Tang et al., 2005) . Using an MOI of 100 TCID 50 units, gene expression profiles were compared at 2 and 4 h post infection, very early times in the lifecycle of SARS-CoV. At these early timepoints, IL-8 expression levels were increased while neither IP-10 nor IFN␣/␤ were significantly up-regulated. Importantly, Huh7 cells have been shown to be deficient in some antiviral responses which are in conflict with these findings (Lanford et al., 2003) . This likely suggests that Huh7 cells are defective for the double stranded RNA sensing response, consisting of RIGI and Mda5, which would hamper the useful interpretation of these results. In contrast to the results obtained in the studies by Tang, Speigel, and Cinatl, which suggest that SARS-CoV is a poor inducer of type I IFN responses in productively infected cells, Okabayashi (Okabayashi et al., 2006) found that SARS-CoV infection of Caco2 cells led to high levels of IFN␣/␤, L, IRF-7, OAS, ISG20 and Mx transcripts at 1-2 days post infection using real-time PCR. They also reported significant inductions of IL-8, IL-6, SOCS3 and TLRs 4, 7 and 9 transcripts. The discrepancy between these different studies might reflect differences in timing, assay sensitivity, or even different passage histories of the cell types in question. However, with the exception of the results from Okabayashi, most reports argue that SARS-CoV is a poor inducer of type I IFN in productively infected cells. We cannot reproduce the results reported by Okabayashi et al., as SARS-CoV infection in Caco2 and 293 cells did not induce expression of IFN␣, IFN␤, NFB or p56 (Fig. 4) . However in infected cultures, we also reproduce the noted induction of IP-10 in both cell lines supporting reports by Speigel et al. At this time, the preponderance of data argue that SARS-CoV infection does not induce type I IFNs following productive infection in cell culture. SARS-CoV generally does not induce type I IFN in productively infected cells in culture, which suggests that the virus either suppresses or avoids the induction of type I IFN. In light of these possibilities, we will discuss the coronavirus replication cycle and then identify several specific stages where the virus or its derivatives might activate the type I IFN system. Since specific interactions between coronaviruses and the type I IFN Generation of SARS-CoV infectious clone. The SARS-CoV genome is broken into 6 fragments noted A through F. Each fragment is cloned so as to encode a type II restriction site at either end allowing for directed ligation of all fragments while not changing the amino acids of the encoded proteins. The plasmids are digested and ligated all together to form a single 30 kb fragment. This is used as the template for transcription by T7 polymerase which the 5 most piece has a start site encoded in it. The resulting RNA is electroporated into Vero cells and virus is collected in the media 24 h after electroporation. system are poorly understood, much of this discussion will be based on known mechanisms employed by other viruses. The SARS-CoV is a single-stranded, positive polarity enveloped virus. The genome is approximately 29.7 kb long and is associated with the nucleocapsid (N) protein, forming a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) helical N; the RNP is surrounded by a lipid envelope derived from internal cellular membranes of the host cell. The envelope possesses three major envelope proteins: the S glycoprotein, responsible for the receptor recognition and fusion, and the small envelope protein (E) and the M glycoprotein, which are involved in viral budding and release (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) (Fig. 5) . Minor virion components include ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF6 and ORF3a but these are not essential (Huang et al., 2006 (Huang et al., , 2007 Schaecher et al., 2007; Shen et al., 2005) . The replicase ORF 1a and ORF 1b encode critical functions for virus replication and likely encode important virulence determinants (Eckerle et al., 2006; Sperry et al., 2005) . During the coronavirus life cycle (Fig. 6) , there are several steps where cellular proteins could detect viral components (Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005) . Coronavirus entry is thought to be a three stage process including binding of S glycoprotein to the Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE2) protein, cleavage by cathepsin L and activation of a fusion peptide in S2 that mediates entry via fusion through endocytic compartments (Simmons et al., 2005) . Fusion, which for SARS happens in an endosomal type structure after cathepsin L cleaves the viral S glycoprotein, viral RNA, which is tightly bound by the N, is released into the cytoplasm of the cell. Following viral genome release into the cytosol, the genome is translated into the viral replicase proteins ORF1a and 1b. These polyproteins are then cleaved by two proteases, a papain like protease (PLP) and the main protease (Mpro), into the individual proteins necessary for replication. The incoming genomic RNA then serves as a template for the synthesis of full length and subgenomic length negative strand RNAs that serves as template for mRNA synthesis. Subgenomic RNA synthesis occurs from discontinuous transcription that joins leader RNA sequences encoded at the 5 end of the genome to the body sequences of each subgenomic RNA. The model of transcription attenuation argues that the replicase binds to the 3 end of the genomic RNA, transcribes incomplete negative strands that terminate in highly conserved transcription regulatory sequences (TRS) defined by the sequence ACGAAC, dissociates and re-associates with the full length template near the 5 end of the genome to prime transcription of subgenomic negative strand RNAs containing anti-leader RNA sequences. The eight different subgenomic negative strands serve as template for the synthesis of like sized subgenomic mRNA (Brian and Baric, 2005) . Replicase, structural and accessory proteins are produced during this phase of replication at which time the structural proteins M and E localize to the golgi apparatus and transverse to a ER/golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) where budding occurs. Also during this phase, accessory proteins are produced that localize throughout the cell. During virus production, replicase proteins have been shown to localize to double membrane vesicles in the cell that are induced during viral replication in both MHV and SARS-CoV (Brockway et al., 2003; Goldsmith et al., 2004; Gosert et al., 2002; Snijder et al., 2006; van der Meer et al., 1999) . The membranes of which are the site of replication and viral assembly. How the structural E, M, and S proteins re-localize to these structures is unknown. It has recently been shown that SARS-CoV E and M proteins do not re-localize to the double membrane structures while for MHV they do (Snijder et al., 2006) . Whether this difference is cell specific, virus specific or experimentally specific is unknown. Also whether the replicase proteins are functioning on the inside of the vesicles or in the cytoplasm is unclear. Once assembly occurs, the virus is secreted using the secretory apparatus of the cell, however, whether coronaviruses pass through the Golgi stacks or use specialized vesicular routes is unknown. Once at the cell membrane, the vesicles carrying the virions fuse with the cell surface and release mature virus into the extracellular space. During the replication of coronaviruses, many sentinel sites in the cell's antiviral machinery are potentially impacted, yet with the exception of 229E, the majority of coronaviruses that have been evaluated, fail to induce type I IFN responses (Pitkaranta and Hovi, 1993) . Though the specific mechanisms underlying this immune evasion are not well understood, some potential mechanisms will be discussed below. During entry, the fusion of the virion either at the membrane or in a vacuole, releases genomic RNA into the cytoplasm. Endosome associated TLRs, such as TLR3 or TLR7 may detect SARS-CoV genomic RNA during entry; alternatively the cytoplasmic RNA sensors, RIG-I and Mda5 might detect the RNA as it enters into the cytoplasm. However, a specific role for TLRs or RIG-I/Mda5 in detecting coronaviruses has not been reported, yet several virus families encode products that antagonize signaling at this level (Kash et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2005) . Coronaviruses may also encode proteins which block the viral RNA signaling and sensing pathways. Although specific mechanisms have not been elucidated, it is possible that the viral genome is sequestered, perhaps by the viral N protein, in such a way that the viral RNA is shielded from host sensor proteins. Other viral proteins, such as NS1 of influenza and VP35 of Ebola virus have been shown to block type I IFN induction by interfering with the ability of host sensor proteins (IRF-3, Stat1, RigI, MDA5) to detect incoming virus (Hartman et al., 2004; Kash et al., 2006) . For many coronaviruses, there is no known mechanism of how they evade the host innate immune system. It is hypothesized that it is by either (1) actively producing IFN antagonist proteins, (2) using their own replicase proteins to modify host proteins or by (3) the formation of double membrane vesicles and compartmentalizing replication and perhaps other coronavirus RNAs. The use of double membrane vesicles could hide the RNAs produced by protecting them from the RNA sensing machinery. There may also be a role for N in shielding the viral RNAs from the dsRNA and ssRNA sensing pathways. Many of these possibilities are being actively investigated. In addition to simply avoiding the activation of type I IFN responses by either masking the viral RNA or sequestering the viral replication complexes into specialized compartments, it is possible that SARS-CoV or other coronaviruses actively inhibit type I IFN induction or signaling. Speigel et al. demonstrated that SARS-CoV infection failed to activate IFN␤ promoter activity, but that IRF-3 was translocated to the nucleus in SARS-CoV infected cells (Spiegel et al., 2005) . However, SARS-CoV infection interfered with IRF-3 hyper-phosphorylation, dimer formation, and interactions with its essential co-factor, chromatin binding protein (CBP). The role for a specific viral gene or genes in mediating this antagonism has not been described and needs to be evaluated in further detail. To investigate this concept further, two recent papers have shown that MHV and SARS do not block the IRF-3 signaling pathway in infected cells. Zhou et al. demonstrated that although MHV does not induce nuclear translocation of IRF-3 or IFN␤ gene induction it does not block these pathways either (Zhou and Perlman, 2007) . Subsequent treatment of cells with poly-I:C or Sendai Virus post infection allows for proper nuclear import of IRF-3 and induction of IFN␤ mRNA. They also show that RIGI, MDA5 and TLR3 are also not inhibited by MHV infection. Similar results were shown by Versteed et al. for MHV and SARS-CoV (Versteeg et al., 2007) . They also show that MHV does not induce IRF-3 nuclear translocation and IFN␣ gene induction but that each of these is activated when cells are treated with poly-I:C or Sendai Virus. In addition they show that SARS acts the same way in culture; it does not induce the IFN sensing pathway but does not block the pathways either. Each hypothesizes that there may protection via compartmentalization of the replication complexes and replication RNA in the cell that protects it from being sensed by the anti-viral machinery. Versteeg et al. also proposes that since the 5 end of SARS RNA is capped it is protected from recognition by RIGI since it was recently shown that RIGI specifically binds to free phosphates at the 5 end of the RNA (Hornung et al., 2006; Pichlmair et al., 2006 ). This may be another level of protection SARS-CoV uses to block its sensing from the cellular anti-viral machinery. We have shown similar data for SARS infections in vitro. We find that SARS infection does not induce IFN␤ or NFB gene induction, however, they do not block those pathways either ( Fig. 7A and B) . Promoters of IFN␤ and NFB were assayed for their ability to drive luciferase expression after infection by SARS. Wild-type SARS infection of cells does not activate the induction of the either of the promoters however each could be activated post infection by poly-I:C (data not shown), exogenous IFN␤ (data not shown) or Sendai Virus ( Fig. 7A and B) similar to Zhou et al. and Versteed et al. We created recombinant SARS viruses deleted for each of the SARS accessory ORFs: ORF3a, 3b, 3ab, 3ab/6, 6, 7a, 7b, 8b and 9b. We hypothesized a SARS-CoV accessory ORF may be mediating the IFN sensing block in vivo. However we find that similar to wildtype SARS-CoV, all the deletions fail to induce any of the promoters analyzed above. All of the deletions also allowed for induction post infection by Sendai Virus and poly-I:C of the IFN␤, NFB and p56 promoters assayed. Our data combined with Zhou et al. and Versteeg et al. lead us to hypothesize that there is a mechanism by which MHV and SARS-CoV evade detection of by innate immune system by (1) sequestering the viral genome on membranous replication complexes, (2) capping viral RNA to evade detection by one arm of the dsRNA sensing machinery and (3) potentially actively inhibiting the innate immune system by the function of virally encoded proteins. One caveat to this work is that SARS-CoV could be inhibiting IFN signaling pathways that are detrimental to its own replication and survival but not inhibiting different pathways inducible by SeV and poly-I:C. In vivo experiments where putative viral antagonists are debilitated or where replication complexes are retargeted to new sites (e.g. autophagy mutants that do not produce double membrane vescicles) may provide insight into which of these hypotheses are most likely. Recent work by Kopecky-Bromberg et al. has identified three SARS proteins, ORF3b, ORF6 and the N protein, that interact with the different elements of the IFN sensing machinery and may add another layer of protection from the innate immune system (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007) . When expressed in 293 cells from a plasmid, each viral ORF not only blocked expression from an IFN␤ and IRF-3 promoter reporter plasmid but also Fig. 8 . SARS-CoV ORF6 blocks nuclear import of Stat1. (a) Two hundred and ninety three cells were transfected with a plasmid containing an ISRE promoter driving luciferase and either CAGGS/GFP or CAGGS/ORF6. The 24 h post transfection half of the wells were treated with IFN␤ for 4 h and then assayed by Steady-Glo Luciferase Reagent (Promega) for ISRE promoter induction. (b) Two hundred and ninety three cells were transfected with HA tagged ORF6. The 24 h post transfection cells were treated with 100 IU/ml of IFN␤ for 1 h. Cells were then lysed and assayed by western blot for the presence of total STAT1 (top panel) or phosphorylated STAT1 (bottom panel). (c) Vero cells were transfected with either STAT1/GFP alone or co-transfected with the designated plasmids for 24 h. After 24 h, cells were either untreated or treated with IFN␤ or IFN␥ as designated. Notice STAT1 is cytoplasmic when untreated but is transported to the nucleus when treated with either IFN␤ or IFN␥. Co-expression of SARS ORF6 retains STAT1 in the cytoplasm while SARS 3a expression does not. Also notice that SARS ORF6 blocks IFN␥ induced STAT1 nuclear translocation as well. blocked IRF-3 phosphorylation. N expression blocked NFB promoter induction while ORF3b and 6 did not, demonstrating an interesting difference in their IFN blocking mechanism. One other distinction between the three genes is that all three blocked expression from an ISRE promoter reporter construct when the cells were stimulated with Sendai Virus, but only 3b and 6 blocked induction of the ISRE reporter when the cells were treated with IFN␤. Shown in Fig. 8a , ORF6 expressed in 293 cells blocked induction of an ISRE promoter expressing luciferase in response to IFN␤ treatment. These data suggested a direct block of the IFN amplification side of the innate immune pathway; from the IFN␣/␤ receptor to STAT1 nuclear translocation to induction of STAT1 transcribed genes (assayed by the ISRE promoter construct). ORF6 expression does not effect STAT1 phosphorylation but ORF6 blocked nuclear localization of Stat1 after the cells were treated with IFN␤ ( Fig. 8b and c) . This data shows that each of the 3 genes blocks IFN sensing and signaling in a different way, enabling a reduction in the anti-viral induction pathways from several different pathways. A report from Cervantes-Barragan et al. may also connect the differences seen in cell lines versus in vivo experiments (Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2007) . They have found that there is a rapid induction of type I IFNs upon MHV infection of pDCs compared to cDCs that coincided with a block in virus replication. They also show that SARS-CoV reacts similarly as MHV to different types of DCs (cDC versus pDC). They identify a potential mediator of the IFN induction as well. They find that TLR7 seems to be key to the rapid induction seen in pDCs since TLR7−/− pDCs could produce IFN in response to CpG DNA and not MHV. This result shows that TLR7 is not needed for CpG DNA induced IFN induction but the lack of TLR7 inhibited the induction of IFN by MHV. TLR7 may be sensing the MHV virion or replication products to activate the IFN response in cells. Many issues remain unanswered concerning how coronaviruses evade the immune response during infection. With the technology of reverse genetic systems for MHV, SARS-CoV, HCV 229E and TGEV, specific mutations can be made in the viruses to assess individual proteins' role in immune evasion and pathogenesis. The continued identification of proteins in the signaling pathways described above only adds to the abundance of potential host proteins that may be targeted by viral proteins. Additionally, increased knowledge of pathway interregulation and protein:protein interaction networks expand the possible ways that viral pathogens modulate the host response to infection. With these new tools we will be able to gain insight into the critical questions: 1. Which host sensor proteins recognize SARS-CoV genomic RNA or mRNA or viral dsRNA? 2. How do coronaviruses protect their RNA from RNA sensing enzymes in the cell? Does compartmentalization of the replication process keeps the viral RNA in double membrane vesicles and away from the sensing machinery of the host or does an active process of antagonism block sensing of incoming viral genomes? Do these key viral mediators function as virulence alleles and influence disease outcomes? 3. Although coronavirus replicase proteins are highly conserved, the accessory proteins are heterogeneous. Has each virus evolved a different set of IFN antagonizing proteins or are there common mechanisms and protein(s) that functions as an antagonist during coronavirus infection? How many viral antagonist of type I IFN are encoded in the coronavirus genome? Are they species specific? What is their role in pathogenesis? 4. Why is 229E unique in its induction of IFN in culture while the other coronaviruses do not? Does the availability of specific innate immune antagonists modulate the pathogenesis of other human coronaviruses like NL63 and HKU1? 5. Does SARS-CoV or other CoVs induce IFN in monocyte derived cells in a host? In vitro the results are quite different depending on the cell type, origin and preparation. What happens in vivo? 6. Are coronaviruses killed in MPs when they are engulfed during infection? Many SARS-CoV infected lungs show MPs containing SARS-CoV particles. Is this a mechanism for clearance of the virus or is SARS using the MP to evade the immune system and carry the virus deeper into the lung tissue? Do coronaviruses have ways of evading death induced by the MP? Are innate immune responses blocked in during replication in the lung? 7. Are viral proteins acting as intracellular or extracellular IFN antagonists during infection and what stages in the pathways are targeted for inactivation? 8. How does aging impact the innate immunity response and contribute to the increased pathogenesis noted in elderly patients following SARS-CoV infection? It is anticipated that the interactions of coronavirus genomes and gene products with the host innate immune system will provide a robust research agenda over the next several years, yielding critical information that should elucidate many molecular mechanisms that contribute to coronavirus virulence and pathogenesis in human and animal hosts.\",\n",
              " 'Objectives: To evaluate the ability of a high‐cell‐passage canine coronavirus vaccine to immunise dogs against challenge with a field isolate of the virus. Methods: Three dogs that had previously tested seronegative and virus‐negative for canine coronavirus were inoculated twice, at 21‐day intervals, with the vaccine and kept under observation. Two seronegative and virus‐negative dogs served as unvaccinated controls. For safety tests, two additional dogs were inoculated oronasally with 10 times the vaccinal dose and no reactions were observed. Faecal samples were collected daily from the vaccinated dogs after the first and second inoculations. Both vaccinated and control dogs were challenged two weeks after the second vaccination with a field canine coronavirus strain. Blood samples were collected for serological tests before vaccination and at weekly intervals after vaccinations and challenge. Results: Virus was not detected in faecal samples after the first or second vaccinations by virus isolation assays and PCR. Significantly, the vaccinated dogs did not have clinical signs after challenge and no virus shedding was observed. The two unvaccinated control dogs had moderate enteritis, and virus was detected in cell cultures starting from three days postchallenge (dog 1) and two days postchallenge (dog 2), and by PCR for 23 median days. Clinical Significance: This study showed the efficacy of a high‐cell‐passage canine coronavirus vaccine in preventing infection of dogs by virulent virus and, specifically, its ability to induce sterilising immunity. Coronaviruses, of the family Coronaviridae, are large, enveloped, positivestranded RNA viruses and are responsible for some highly prevalent diseases in human beings and domestic animals. Canine coronaviruses (CCoV) cause mild to moderate enteritis in dogs. In young pups, or when the virus occurs with concurrent pathogens, diarrhoea may be severe with dehydration, loss of appetite and even death (Appel 1987) . Infected dogs generally shed CCoV in their faeces for six to nine days after infection (Keenan and others 1976) , although the virus has been detected in faeces up to six months after clinical signs have ceased (Pratelli and others 2001a , 2002b , Pratelli 2006 . CCoV is highly contagious, and once the virus is established in a kennel, the spread of the infection is difficult to control. Crowding, unsanitary conditions, stress during training and other environmental conditions appear to favour the development of clinical disease (Evermann and others 1980 , Yasoshima and others 1983 , Pratelli and others 1999b , 2001b , Decaro and others 2004a . Disinfection of kennels and equipment with 3 per cent hypochlorite solution is effective in killing CCoV, but it does not prevent dog-to-dog transmission. The efficacy and duration of the immunity provided by CCoV vaccines are controversial (Carmichael 1997) . A recent study described the low efficacy of an inactivated CCoV vaccine in reducing viral shedding in the faeces of dogs after challenge (Pratelli and others 2003b) . The safety and immunogenicity of an experimental modified-live CCoV vaccine administered intramuscularly or oronasally were subsequently shown (Pratelli and others 2004) . In this study, PCR showed excretion of the vaccinal virus in the faeces after oronasal inoculation. The present study reports the results of a vaccination trial of a high-cell-passage CCoV vaccine administered via the oronasal route. Seven three-month-old stray dogs, four females and three males, were included in the present study. The dogs tested negative by PCR for CCoV antigens in the faeces and CCoV antibodies in the sera. Baseline body temperature and white blood cell (WBC) count were determined for each dog by calculating an average from the measurements taken three days before vaccination. The experimental study was performed according to the animal health and wellbeing regulations and was authorised by the Italian Ministry of Health (authorisation number: 67/2002-C). After completion of the study, all dogs were adopted by private individuals, except one that remained in the study kennel. The policy of the kennel and local ordinances requires that the dogs be humanely cared for. The modified-live CCoV vaccine strain (strain 257/98-3c) used was originally isolated from a dog with mild enteritis (Pratelli and others 2004) . The virus at the 40th passage on canine cells (A-72) was subsequently passaged an additional 20 times. The new vaccine stock, CCoVhcp, had an infectivity titre of 10 5Á75 tissue cultured infectious dose (TCID) 50 /50 ll, and tests using standardised methods for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, mycoplasmas, mycetes and contaminant viruses were negative. The viral suspension was sterilised by passage through a filter of 0Á22 lm (Millex; Millipore Corporation). Cell cultures infected for 24 hours were tested for pestivirs using an immunofluorescence test with monoclonal antibodies. To evaluate the presence of both moulds and yeasts, the vaccine stock was cultured onto Sabouraud dextrose agar with 0Á5 g/l chloramphenicol (BioLife Italiana S.r.l.), and incubated at 25°C for seven days and 30°C for 14 days. The safety of the CCoV-hcp vaccine was evaluated in two dogs that were given oronasal inoculations of the vaccine at a dose 10 times greater than that used in the efficacy test. The two control dogs were given 7 ml by the intranasal route plus 3 ml orally. Following inoculation, the dogs were housed individually and examined daily for 28 days for signs of illness, including WBC counts and body temperatures. Individual faecal samples were collected for the virological assays that were carried out from three days before the test through to day 28. On day 28, blood was taken from all dogs for serological testing. After an acclimatisation period of 10 days, three dogs were kept isolated in separate rooms and handled by separate operators. Each dog was then vaccinated by the oronasal route with 4 ml of CCoV-hcp (1 ml by nasal route and 3 ml by oral route). Twenty-one days later, the dogs received a second oronasal dose of the vaccine as before. Two dogs were housed separately and were not vaccinated (control group). After the first and second vaccinations, the dogs were observed to watch for any adverse local or systemic reactions, and faecal samples were collected daily for 21 days post-first vaccination (dpfv) and for 14 days post-second vaccination (dpsv). Fourteen days after the second dose, both the vaccinated and control dogs were challenged with a CCoV field strain (strain 144/01) that had been isolated from a diarrhoeic pup (Marsilio and others 2002) . The virus was propagated in primary canine embryonic kidney cell cultures for three passages and stored at 270°C. Each challenged dog received 4 ml of viral suspension (1 ml intranasally and 3 ml orally) with a titre of 10 5Á75 TCID 50 /50 ll. On the day of challenge, and for 14 days post-challenge (dpc), both the vaccinated and the control dogs were examined for signs of illness, and virus shedding was monitored daily. Because CCoV does not usually cause clinical disease in experimentally challenged susceptible dogs, the challenge study was monitored by evaluating median days of viral shedding. Blood samples were collected from the three vaccinated dogs before vaccination and on seven, 14 and 21 dpfv and on seven and 14 dpsv. Additional samples were collected from both vaccinated and control dogs, at seven and 14 dpc. All were tested for antibody responses to monitor seroconversion. Faecal samples collected from the vaccinated and control dogs were tested by virus isolation and PCR assays. To attempt virus isolation, samples were homogenised (10 per cent weight/volume) in minimal essential medium, treated with antibiotics (5000 IU/ml penicillin, 2500 lg/ml streptomycin and 10 lg/ml amphotericin B) and inoculated in duplicate onto freshly trypsinised A-72 cells in 24-well plates containing glass slides. The monolayers were observed daily for any cytopathic effects, and after 72 hours the cells were fixed in cold acetone and examined by an immunofluorescence test using a coronavirus monoclonal antibody. Samples were considered to be negative if no cytopathic effects or immunofluorescence occurred after three serial passages. PCR assays were performed as previously reported (Pratelli and others 1999a) . Viral RNA was extracted from clinical specimens using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The target sequence was a fragment of the gene encoding for the membrane protein M of CCoV, which amplified a 409 base pair fragment. Reverse transcription was performed in a total reaction volume of 20 ll containing 1Â PCR buffer (50mM KCl and 10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8Á3), 5mM MgCl 2 , 1mM of each deoxynucleotide (dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP), 1 U RNAse inhibitors, 2Á5 U murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase and 2Á5 U random hexamers. Synthesis of complementary DNA was carried out at 42°C for 30 minutes, followed by a denaturation step at 99°C for five minutes. The mixture was brought up to a total volume of 100 ll, containing 1Â PCR buffer, 2mM MgCl 2 , 2Á5 U Amplitaq Gold DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmer Cetus) and 50 pmol of each primer. Amplification was performed under the following PCR conditions: 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for one minute, annealing at 55°C for one minute and extension at 72°C for one minute. Negative and positive samples, faeces from specific pathogen-free dogs and CCoV strain S/378, respectively, were used as PCR controls. The final products were detected by gel electrophoresis, ethidium bromide staining and UV light transillumination. ELISA and virus neutralisation tests were carried out on all serum samples, as described by Pratelli and others (2002a) . In duplicate 96-well microtitration plates (Falcon-Becton, Dickinson Labware), serial twofold dilutions of each serum sample, starting from 1:2, were mixed with 100 TCID 50 /50 ll of CCoV, strain S/378, with an infectivity titre of 10 6Á5 TCID 50 /50 ll. The plates were kept at room temperature for 90 minutes and then 20,000 freshly trypsinised A-72 cells were added to each well. Plates were incubated for five days at 37°C. The virus neutralisation antibody titre was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that completely inhibited viral cytopathic effects. Antibody titres lower than 1:2 were considered negative. Immunoplates (NUNC; Roskilde) were coated with 25 lg/ml CCoV type II antigen, strain 45/93 (Buonavoglia and others 1994) , diluted in carbonate buffer (15mM Na 2 CO 3 , 35mM NaHCO 3 and 0Á02 per cent NaN 3 , pH 9Á6) and incubated overnight at 4°C with shaking. The plates were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer containing 0Á05 per cent Tween 20 (PBS-T) and then treated with a blocking solution of 0Á2 per cent gelatin in carbonate buffer for 90 minutes at 37°C and again washed with PBS-T. Each dog serum, diluted 1/50 in PBS-T, was added in duplicate and the plates were incubated for 90 minutes at 37°C. After a washing cycle, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-dog immunoglobulin IgG (Sigma Chemicals), diluted in PBS-T, was added to each well and the plates were incubated for one hour at 37°C. After another washing cycle, freshly prepared substrates were placed into each well. The solution consisted of 10 mg 2,2#-azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate] diammonium salt ([ABTS] Sigma Chemicals) in 5 0ml 0Á05M phosphate citrate buffer, pH 5Á0, containing 25 ll/ 100 ml hydrogen peroxide. After adding the stop buffer solution (1 per cent sodium dodecyl sulphate), the optical densities (ODs) were determined at 405 nm using an automatic ELISA reader (Biorad; Hercules). The adjusted OD values of each sample were obtained by subtracting the absorbance of the mock antigen-coated well from that of the corresponding virus antigen-coated well. Samples with OD values more than 0Á040 were considered to be positive. Faecal secretory IgA antibodies were evaluated by ELISA (Decaro and others 2004b) in all dogs after vaccination and challenge, and two weeks after challenge in the control dogs. Briefly, immunoplates were coated with CCoV antigen diluted in carbonate buffer and treated with blocking solution. Faecal samples, diluted 1/25 in PBS-T, were added in duplicate, and the plates were incubated for 90 minutes at 37°C. The washing cycle was then repeated and 100 ll of goat anti-dog IgA horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bethyl Laboratories) was added to each well. The plates were then incubated for one hour at 37°C. After a washing cycle, 10 mg of freshly prepared substrate, ABTS, was added and the OD at 405 nm determined. The cut-off value was defined as OD less than 0Á060. Virus neutralisation titres were expressed as geometric means and OD values as median values. The two dogs that received oronasal inoculations of 10 times the vaccinal dose to test the safety of the high-cell-passage vaccine did not have any local or systemic reactions and their WBC counts remained normal throughout the observation period. Faecal samples collected for 28 days post-vaccination (dpv) were consistently negative by virus isolation and PCR assays. Serological tests (virus neutralisation and ELISA) performed on 28 dpv indicated that the two control dogs had developed an immune response (Table 1) . After the first vaccination, all faecal samples collected from the three dogs used in the efficacy test were consistently negative by both virus isolation and PCR tests. The sera collected on seven and 14 dpfv also tested negative by virus neutralisation and ELISA. The sera collected on 21 dpfv had low antibody titres (1:2) in the virus neutralisation test and the ELISA showed a moderate reactivity (median OD 0Á048). The median ELISA IgA OD value was 0Á046 at day 0 and increased at 21 dpfv to 0Á344 (Table 2) . As expected, CCoV was not detected by virus isolation or PCR in the faeces of the dogs after the second vaccination or during the entire observation period (14 dpsv). The virus neutralisation test showed a slight increase in the antibody titre (1:4) from seven to 14 dpsv. With the ELISA test, high antibody values were observed both on seven dpsv (median OD 0Á255) and 14 dpsv (median OD 0Á345). ELISA IgA median OD values were 0Á356 on seven dpsv and 0Á372 on 14 dpsv (Table 2) . After challenge with field strain 144/ 01, the vaccinated dogs did not develop clinical signs, and virus isolation and PCR did not detect viral shedding. Neutralising antibodies in the vaccinated dogs increased progressively to approximately 1:25 (geometric mean) on 14 dpc. The OD values from the ELISA test also increased progressively, reaching a median value of 0Á411 on 14 dpc. The median ELISA IgA OD value on seven dpc was 0Á402, and it increased to 0Á473 on 14 dpc ( Table 2) . The two control dogs developed mild diarrhoea for an average of three days after challenge, and virus was isolated in cell cultures from their faeces starting from three dpc (dog 1) and two dpc (dog 2). By PCR, virus was detected from one to 14 dpc (dog 1 and dog 2). Virus neutralisation tests showed that antibodies had increased by 14 dpc (geometric mean 22Á4). The serum ELISA test also showed the highest OD values on 14 dpc (median OD 0Á250). Faecal ELISA IgAs had a median OD of 0Á116 on 14 dpc (Table 2) . CCoV was discovered as a causative agent of enteritis in dogs in 1971 (Binn and others 1974) . The importance of this pathogen has been underestimated probably because of the difficulty in identifying the virus using conventional virological assays (Pratelli and others 2000) and in reproducing clinical disease in dogs under experimental conditions. Situations that cause stress in dogs, such as poor nutrition or overcrowding, and concurrent infections with other pathogens have been hypothesised to contribute to the severity of CCoV disease in field cases (Evermann and others 1980 , Yasoshima and others 1983 , Pratelli and others 1999b , 2001b , Decaro and others 2004a . Fulker and others (1995) produced clinical disease in dogs after CCoV inoculation, followed by treatment with the immunosuppressive drug dexamethasone. In that study, the authors showed that an inactivated CCoV vaccine could induce an immune response that protected dogs against clinical signs. Because CCoV, in the absence of immunosuppression, does not cause clinical disease in experimentally challenged dogs, monitoring the reduction of viral shedding has been used to test the efficacy of CCoV vaccines. In a recent study, it was found that the inactivated vaccine had poor efficacy in reducing faecal shedding of CCoV following infection with a field strain of the virus (Pratelli and others 2003b) . Subsequently, the safety and efficacy of a modified-live CCoV vaccine (strain 257/98-3c) was evaluated in 14 dogs. The study showed that there were no adverse reactions in dogs after the inoculation of the modified-live vaccine and that viral nucleic acid was detected by PCR for six dpfv in dogs that had been inoculated oronasally (Pratelli and others 2004) . The aim of the present study was to develop a safe and immunogenic vaccine that would not result in virus shedding. For this purpose, the modified-live CCoV vaccine (Pratelli and others 2004) was further attenuated (60 passages) and tested for its ability to immunise dogs. Because CCoV is considered a poor immunogen, dogs were vaccinated twice by the oronasal route. Of interest was the significant immune response observed in the sera and in the faeces of all dogs after the second inoculation. After challenge at 14 dpsv, protection from CCoV infection was complete because no viral shedding was observed by either virus isolation or PCR tests. Protection against CCoV infections has generally been associated with the presence of specific antibodies on the mucosal surface. Therefore, mucosal IgA in the vaccinated dogs (Table 2) might be responsible for the protection observed (Ogra and others 1980 , Saif 1996 , Murphy 1999 , Decaro and others 2004b . Although CCoV infections do not appear to be a major cause of life-threatening enteritis in dogs, severe illness as a consequence of dual infections has been observed (Evermann and others 1980 , Yasoshima and others 1983 , Pratelli and others 1999b , 2001b , Decaro and others 2004a . Because multiple infections are common in high-density populations, such as in unvaccinated kennels, and that dogs may shed the virus for as long as six months after the clinical signs have ceased (Pratelli and others 2001a, 2002b) , it seems that immunisation of dogs to produce a sterilising immunity would have beneficial epidemiological effects in controlling the spread of CCoV in high-risk dog populations. Epidemiological monitoring of the evolution of CCoV is particularly important for the development of rational prophylaxis. For example, documentation of recombination events affecting CCoV may further explain the evolutionary processes leading to the emergence of new virus strains, serotypes or subtypes, as has occurred with SARS-CoV, with the new genotype of CCoV (Pratelli and others 2003a) and with the new pathogenic variant of CCoV isolated from the organs of dog with severe lesions (Buonavoglia and others 2006) . The present study has shown the efficacy of a high-cell-passage CCoV vaccine in preventing infection of dogs by virulent virus and, specifically, its ability to induce sterilising immunity.',\n",
              " \"The resistance of immunized mice to challenge with the same or a different strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) was examined as a model of challenge immunity to coronavirus infection. Genetically susceptible BALB/cByJ mice were given an intranasal immunizing infection of respiratory-type MHV-JHM, MHV-S, or enterotropic MHV-Y. Control mice were sham-immunized with sterile tissue culture fluid. Recovered mice were challenged intranasally with MHV-JHM, MHV-S or sterile tissue culture fluid at 30 days after immunization. Resistance to challenge inoculation was evaluated in groups of mice at 4 and 30 days after challenge. At 4 days, the prevalence of MHV lesions in nose and liver was tabulated and MHV titers in liver were determined. At 30 days, the prevalence of residual brainstem spongiform lesions was tabulated and serum antibody to MHV-JHM and MVH-S was quantified by enzyme immunoassay. Mice immunized with MHV-JHM or MHV-S resisted challenge with the MHV homotype, but MHV-S-immunized mice were fully susceptible to challenge with MVH-JHM. Mice immunized with enterotropic MHV-Y were only partially protected against challenge with antigenically related, but biologically different MHV-S. Serum antibody responses to MHV supported these observations. These data indicate that challenge immunity to coronaviruses is strong, but highly virus strain-specific. Coronaviruses are common respiratory and enteric pathogens of a variety of birds and mammals, including man. About 15% of common colds in man are caused by coronaviruses [25] . The frequency of repeated colds in a single individual and the frequency of association with a coronaviral etiology suggest that an individual can be repeatedly infected with coronaviruses. If so, host immunity is ineffective, or effectively directed toward virus strain-specific antigens. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is an extensively studied coronavirus that might provide insight into the mechanism of this phenomenon. This virus is represented by many different strains that vary biologically and possess minor antigenic differences. Different MHV strains display primary tropism for either the upper respiratory or enteric mucosa [ 1] . They share complex antigenic interrelationships, with cross-reactivity among themselves, as well as with coronaviruses of rats, man (OC 43 group), cattle and pigs (hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus) [ 16] . Like other coronaviruses, the MHV virion consists of 3 major antigenic components: nucleoprotein (N), membrane glycoprotein (E 1), and peplomeric glycoprotein (E 2). N and E 1 antigens are highly conserved among MHV strains, but E 2 is polymorphic and responsible for MHV strain-specific antigenic identity [13, 24] . E2 is the primary target for neutralizing antibody [9, 10, 13] and challenge immunity of mice to MHV can be induced by vaccination with whole virus or peplomers, but not membrane or nucleoprotein subcomponents [18] . This would suggest that effective host immunity to virus challenge is directed toward the most strain-specific antigenic epitopes of the virion. The polymorphism of E 2 possibly represents an effective survival strategy of the virus to evade immune clearance from a host population. Indeed, E 2 antigenic changes can be readily selected by escape from neutralization with monoclonal antibodies in vitro [11] . The purpose of this study was to examine the specificity of host challenge immunity against the same virus or against virus strains that differed biologically or antigenicatly from the immunizing strain, using an MHV model. Intranasal (i.n.) immunization and challenge with live virus were chosen to mimic a natural route of exposure. The resistance of previously immunized mice to challenge with the same or a different strain of MHV was examined following i.n. immunization and challenge. Three MHV strains were used. MHV-JHM and MHV-S are antigenic heterotypes by serum neutralization [8, 15] , but are biologically similar, since they both have primary upper respiratory tropism, with secondary tropism for liver and brain [5] [6] [7] . MHV-Y is closely related to MHV-S antigenically, but differs biologically from MHV-S being primarily enterotropic with minimal tropism for liver and brain I6, 8] . BALB/cByJ mice were used because of their genetic susceptibility to the MHV strains used [2, 7] . Immunization was accomplished by i.n. inoculation of 3 week old mice with live MHV-JHM, MHV-S, MHV-Y or sterile tissue culture fluid (TCF). Mice were held for 30 days, an interval in which mice recover from MHV infection after i.n. inoculation I-2, 7], and were then challenged i.n. with MHV-JHM, MHV-S or TCF. Resistance to challenge was evaluated by microscopic examination of nose at 4 days after challenge. This site is the primary mucosal target of MHV-JHM and MHV-S [7, 22] . The ability of challenge virus to spread to secondary target organs (liver and brain) was also assessed as an index of susceptibility. Dissemination of MHV was measured by microscopic examination and virus titration of liver at 4 days after challenge. Four days is a peak interval for acute MHV disease following i.n. inoculation [7] . MHV-JHM and MHV-S also spread directly to brain from nose via olfactory nerves, leaving a high prevalence of residual brainstem spongiosis at 30 days after i.n. inoculation 1 '3, 4] . Thus, brains Challenge immunity to coronavirus 189 were examined at 30 days after challenge. Sera from mice killed at 30 days after challenge were tested for antibody to MHV-S and MHV-JHM. Treatment groups and the number of mice in each are summarized in Tables 1-3 Three-week-old inbred BALB/cByJ and adult pregnant outbred CR 1 : CD 1 BR Swiss mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, and Charles River Laboratories, Portage, MI, respectively. Mice from both sources were serologically verified as MHV-free. Mice were shipped in filtered boxes and transferred upon arrival into autoclaved Micro-isolator containment cages (Lab Products, Maywood, N J) containing wood shavings, food (Purina Laboratory Chow, Ralston Purina Company, St. Louis, MO) and water. Pathogen-free sentinel mice were maintained in adjacent, open cages and tested periodically for serum MHV antibody to monitor for inadvertant contamination of the room with wildtype or experimental MHV strains. Sera of mice killed on day 4 after challenge (34 days after immunization) or at the time of challenge were tested for MHV antibody to verify immunization status. Mice were selected randomly from treatment groups and were killed with carbon dioxide gas, followed by cardiac exsanguination. Sera and liver were stored at --70 °C until tested for antibody or virus. Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, pH 7.2, paraffin embedded, and processed by routine histological methods. MHV-JHM and MHV-S were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD. MHV-JHM was subsequently passaged twice in NCTC 1469 cells, once in adult BALB/cByJ mouse liver and once in 17C11 cells. MHV-S was passaged in NCTC 1469 cells. MHV-Y was obtained from an outbreak in infant mice and maintained by infant mouse passage I-8]. Aliquots of each virus inoculum were frozen at --70 °C until used. Mice were inoculated i.n. with 20 gl of cell-free culture fluid containing approxiamtely 10 3 TCIDs0 of MHV. Virus in liver was titrated by intracerebral inoculation of infant Swiss mice with serial 10-fold w/v dilutions of tissue homogenates, as previously described [7] , and expressed as log10 LDs0/gram. Serum MHV antibody titers were determined using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with formalin-fixed MHV-JHM-or MHV-S-infected 17 C11 cells as antigen [7, 21] . Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Tago, Burlingame, CA) and ABTS substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) were used in these tests. To verify immune status at the time of challenge or to monitor for inadvertant MHV contamination of treatment groups, sera were tested for MHV antibody by indirect immunofluorescence assay [19] . Virus titers were compared between groups with Student's unpaired t test. Prevalence data were compared by Chi-square analysis. Based upon nose and liver lesion prevalence as well as MHV titers in liver during the acute phase of challenge infection (day 4), mice resisted MHV challenge when immunized with the same MHV strain, but were susceptible to 190 S.W. Barthold . Immunized mice challenged with the MHV homotype had virtually no nose or liver lesions compared to sham-immunized mice. MHV-JHM and MHV-S immunized mice had significantly lower virus titers in their livers compared to sham-immunized mice challenged with MHV-JHM or MHV-S (P~0.001 and P ~ 0.05, respectively). Mice immunized with MHV-S, then challenged with MHV-JHM, developed a similar prevalence of nose and liver lesions and similar virus titers in liver compared to sham-immunized mice, indicating no resistance to challenge. Mice immunized with enterotropic MHV-Y, then challenged with antigenically related, but biologically different MHV-S, had fewer nose lesions (P~<0.01) but a similar prevalence of liver lesions and comparable liver virus titers compared to sham-immunized, MHV-S challenged mice. Conversely, nose lesion prevalence did not differ from MHV-S immunized, MHV-S challenged mice, but liver lesion prevalence (P~< 0.01) and liver virus titers (P~< 0.01) were significantly higher. The presence of brain lesions at 30 days after challenge also reflected virus type-specific immunity ( Table 2) . Immunized mice developed a low prevalence of or no spongiform brain lesions when challenged with the antigenically homotypic MHV strain, compared to sham-immunized controls. In contrast to liver, brains of mice immunized with enterotropic MHV-Y were protected from challenge with antigenically similar, but biologically different MHV-S. Brain lesions seen at 30 days after challenge were due to the challenge, rather than the immunizing infection, since mice that were immunized with TCF, MHV-JHM, MHV-S or MHV-Y, then sham-challenged had no detectable spongiform brain lesions remaining at 30 days after sham challenge. Seroconversion and antibody titers to MHV-JHM and MHV-S reflected the antigenic experience of immunized and challenged mice at 30 days after challenge (Table 3) . Sera from sham-inoculated mice (group 7) did not react with either antigen. Sera from mice inoculated only with MHV-JHM 30 and/ or 60 days prior to bleeding (groups 1, 2, and 8) reacted with both homologous and heterologous antigen in the EIA. Sera from mice inoculated only with MHV-S groups 3, 4, and 9) uniformly reacted with homologous antigen, but not all sera reacted with MHV-JHM. Among these groups, there was not an obvious correlation between high titer to MHV-S and reactivity with MHV-JHM. Sera from mice immunized with MHV-Y and challenged with MHV-S (group 6) reacted with MHV-S to the same extent as sera from mice that were immunized but not challenged (group 10). However, sera from group 6 mice reacted relatively poorly with MHV-JHM anigen. Sera from mice immunized with MHV-S and challenged with MhV-JHM (group 5) reacted more uniformly and to substantially higher titer with MHV-JHM than sera from mice immunized with MHV-S but not challenged (group 9). Challenge resistance of immunized mice appears to depend upon both the antigenic type and the biotype of the MHV strains used to immunize and challenge. Mice immunized with respiratory-type MHV-JHM or MHV-S resisted challenge with the antigenic MHV homotype, but were as susceptible as naive mice to challenge with the antigenic heterotype. Mice immunized with Challenge immunity to coronavirus 193 MHV-JHM and challenged with MHV-S were not examined because of the extremely high mortality due to encephalitis among mice infected i.n. with MHV-JHM. All surviving MHV-JHM immunized mice were used to test resistance to MHV-JHM. Mice immunized with enterotropic MHV-Y were only partially protected against challenge with biologically different respiratory-type MHV-S, despite their close antigenic relatedness by serum neutralization. Mice immunized with MHV-S and challenged with MHV-Y were not studied because MHV-Y has minimal tropism for brain or liver, which were the target organs used to measure challenge resistance. Antigenic relationships among different MHV strains are complex and difficult to define. Nucleocapsid and E 1 membrane antigens are substantially conserved among MHV strains, while E 2 peplomeric antigens are highly variable, although there are conserved E 2 epitopes as well [13] . Neutralizing antibody is directed primarily at E2 antigens [10] , and is used as a measure of antigenic variation among MHV strains [8, 15] . Although the immune response is directed toward N, E 1 and E 2 antigens, effective challenge immunity appears to be E2-mediated. Resistance to intraperitoneal (i.p.) challenge with MHV can be induced against the MHV homotype by prior vaccination with inactivated whole virus or peplomers, but not with virus membrane or nucleoprotein subcomponents [18] . Challenge resistance to MHV could be conferred passively with two of three neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to epitopes of E 2, but not non-neutralizing antibodies to E 2, E 1 or N antigens [9] . These observations tend to support the current findings of virus strain-specific challenge immunity. Further support includes a study in which mice immunized i.p. with live MHV-1 were not protected against i.p. challenge with MHV-3 [12] . On the other hand, mice immunized i.n. with live MHV-S resisted a normally lethal i.p. challenge with MHV-2, but MHV-S antibody neutralizes MHV-2, suggesting E 2 cross-reactivity between these strains [23] . Mice immunized i.n. with MHV-JHM were also protected against death when challenged i.n. with MHV-3 [14] . At least one E2 epitope is shared between MHV-JHM and MHV-3 [13] , possibly explaining the cross-protection. In the present study, MHV-JHM and MHV-S were chosen, since they appear to be antigenically disparate by serum cross-neutralization [15] . Under these circumstances, strain specificity of challenge resistance was apparent. Although MHV-Y is closely related to MHV-S by serum neutralization [8] , immunization with MHV-Y conferred only partial protection against MHV-S. Despite the close antigenic relationship, MHV-S and MHV-Y differ significantly biologically. MHV-Y is restrictively enterotropic, with little or no hepatoor neurotropism [2, 6, 8] while MHV-S has primary respiratory tropism with secondary hepato-and neurotropism [4] [5] [6] 22] . Mice immunized with MHV-Y resisted MHV-S challenge at the nasal mucosa and brain, but not liver. This could be explained by the separate pathways by which brain and liver become infected with MHV in adult immunocompetent mice. Following i.n. inoculation, MHV can extend directly into brain via olfactory nerves after replicating initially in nasal olfactory mucosa; however, liver is infected by viremic dissemination [3] . Intranasal alpha/beta interferon treatment can block MHV replication in nasal mucosa and thereby appears to prevent spread of virus to brain, although viremic dissemination to liver still occurs [20] . Likewise, oral inoculation of MHV circumvents the nose-to-brain pathway, but results in hepatitis [3] . Immunization with enterotropic MHV-Y may induce an immune response that is localized to mucosal surfaces, thus protecting nose and brain, but not liver upon MHV-S challenge. The effect could also be a reflection of the close, but not exact, antigenic relatedness of the two MHV strains. The serological responses of mice that were immunized and/or challenged with the MHV strains used in this study raise some interesting questions about the antigens used for detection in the EIA. Sera from mice immunized and/or challenged with MHV-JHM reacted with both homologous and MHV-S antigen. In contrast, sera from mice immunized and/or challenged with MHV-S reacted more uniformly and to substantially higher titer with the homologous antigen. Thus, the MHV-S antigen is more cross-reactive than the MHV-JHM antigen. Infected cell monolayers in which 50-75% of the cells are fused are used as antigen in the EIA [21] . Syncytia formation by MHV relies on the presence of the E 2 glycoprotein which is also the protein against which neutralizing (strain-specific) antibody is directed. The MHV-JHM stock used for 17 C1 1 cell infection produces much larger syncytia than does the MHV-S stock. One explanation for the strain-specific reactivity with MHV-JHM antigen is that relatively higher concentrations of E 2 protein may be expressed by cells infected with this virus. Thus, the EIA may, under certain conditions, be more likely to detect neutralizing antibody than enzyme immunoassays that use immunobilized soluble antigen. These results have demonstrated that mice immunized by i.n. inoculation of live virus are highly resistant to i.n. challenge with the same MHV strain, thus negating the hypothesis that host immunity to coronavirus is ineffective. On the other hand, results demonstrate that immunized mice remain fully susceptible to challenge with a different strain of coronavirus. This reinforces the hypothesis that effective host immunity is directed primarily toward the most variable E 2 component of the virion, explaining susceptibility to repeated infections. Modification of E 2, especially under selective immune pressure, may be a successful survival strategy of coronaviruses to evade clearance from immune populations. The high mutation frequency of RNA viral genomes, the high rate of MHV RNA recombination [17] , the preferential selective pressure on E 2 polymorphism [17, 24] , and the large number of known MHV strains with minor antigenic differences [1] support this premise.\",\n",
              " 'The replication of coronavirus, a family of important animal and human pathogens, is closely associated with the cellular membrane compartments, especially the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Coronavirus infection of cultured cells was previously shown to cause ER stress and induce the unfolded protein response (UPR), a process that aims to restore the ER homeostasis by global translation shutdown and increasing the ER folding capacity. However, under prolonged ER stress, UPR can also induce apoptotic cell death. Accumulating evidence from recent studies has shown that induction of ER stress and UPR may constitute a major aspect of coronavirus–host interaction. Activation of the three branches of UPR modulates a wide variety of signaling pathways, such as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation, autophagy, apoptosis, and innate immune response. ER stress and UPR activation may therefore contribute significantly to the viral replication and pathogenesis during coronavirus infection. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on coronavirus-induced ER stress and UPR activation, with emphasis on their cross-talking to apoptotic signaling. Coronaviruses are a family of enveloped viruses with positive sense, non-segmented, single-stranded RNA genomes. Many coronaviruses are important veterinary pathogens. For example, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) reduces the performance of both meat-type and egg-laying chickens and causes severe economic loss to the poultry industry worldwide (Cavanagh, 2007) . Certain coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, infect humans and account for a significant percentage of adult common colds (Hamre and Procknow, 1966; Kaye et al., 1972) . Moreover, in 2003, a highly pathogenic human coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) with high mortality rate and led to global panic (Ksiazek et al., 2003) . Later, it was found that the SARS-CoV was originated from bat and likely jumped to humans via some intermediate host (palm civets; Li et al., 2005; Wang and Eaton, 2007) . Recently, a live SARS-like coronavirus was isolated from fecal samples of Chinese horseshoe bats, which could use the SARS-CoV cellular receptor -human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) for cell entry (Ge et al., 2013) . This indicates that an intermediate host may not be necessary and direct human infection by some bat coronaviruses is possible. Moreover, a novel human coronavirus -the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), emerged in Saudi Arabia in September 2012 (de Groot et al., 2013) . Although the risk of sustained human-to-human transmission is considered low, infection of MERS-CoV causes ∼50% mortality in patients with comorbidities (Graham et al., 2013) . Initial studies had pointed to bats as the source of MERS-CoV (Annan et al., 2013) ; however, accumulating evidence strongly suggested the dromedary camels to be the natural reservoirs and animal source of MERS-CoV (Hemida et al., 2013; Alagaili et al., 2014) . Thus, coronaviruses can cross the species barrier to become lethal human pathogens, and studies on coronaviruses are both economically and medically important. Taxonomically, the family Coronaviridae is classified into two subfamilies, the coronavirinae and the torovirinae. The coronavirinae is further classified into three genera, namely the Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus (Masters, 2006) . The classification was originally based on antigenic relationships and later confirmed by sequence comparisons of entire viral genomes (Gorbalenya et al., 2004) . Almost all Alphacoronaviruses and Betacoronaviruses have mammalian hosts, including humans. In contrast, Gammacoronaviruses have mainly been isolated from avian hosts. Morphologically, coronaviruses are spherical or pleomorphic in shape with a mean diameter of 80-120 nm. They are characterized by the large (20 nm) \"club-like\" projections on the surface, which are the heavily glycosylated trimeric spike (S) proteins (Masters, 2006) . Two additional structural proteins are found on the envelope. The abundant membrane (M) proteins give the virion its shape, whereas the small envelope (E) proteins play an essential role during assembly (Sturman et al., 1980; Liu and Inglis, 1991) . Inside the envelope, the helical nucleocapsid is formed by binding of the nucleocapsid (N) proteins on the genomic RNA in a beads-on-a-string fashion. The genome, ranging from 27,000 to 32,000 nucleotides in size, is the largest RNA genomes known to date. Coronavirus infection starts with receptor binding via the S protein (Figure 1) . The S proteins of most coronaviruses are www.frontiersin.org FIGURE 1 | Schematic diagram showing the replication cycle of coronavirus and the stages in which ER stress may be induced during coronavirus infection. Infection starts with receptor binding and entry by membrane fusion. After uncoating, the genomic RNA is used as a template to synthesize progeny genomes and a nested set of subgenomic RNAs. The replication transcription centers are closely associated with DMVs, which are proposed to be adopted from the modified ER, possibly by the combined activities of non-structural proteins nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6. The S, E, and M proteins are synthesized and anchored on the ER, whereas the N protein is translated in the cytosol. Assembly takes place in the ERGIC and mature virions are released via smooth-walled vesicles by exocytosis. The three stages that presumably induce ER stress are highlighted with numbered star signs, namely: (1) formation of DMVs, (2) massive production and modification of structural proteins, and (3) depletion of ER membrane during budding. cleaved by host protease into two functional subunits: an Nterminal receptor binding domain (S1) and a C-terminal domain (S2) responsible for membrane fusion (Huang et al., 2006; Qiu et al., 2006; Yamada et al., 2009) . The interaction between the cell surface receptor and the S1 subunit is the major determinant of the tropism of coronaviruses (Kuo et al., 2000) . Upon receptor binding of S1, a conformational change is triggered in the S2 subunit, exposing its hidden fusion peptide for insertion into the cellular membrane. This is followed by the packing of the two heptad repeats in the three monomers into a six-helix bundle fusion core. This close juxtaposition of the viral and cellular membrane enables fusion of the lipid bilayers, and the viral nucleocapsid is thus delivered into the cytoplasm (Masters, 2006) . After uncoating, the genomic RNA first acts as an mRNA for translation of the replicase polyprotein. The replicase gene consists of two open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b). Translation of ORF1a produces the polyprotein 1a (pp1a). Meanwhile, a ribosomal frameshifting occurs at the junction of ORF1a and ORF1b, allowing translation to continue onto ORF1b, producing a larger polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab; Brierley et al., 1987) . Autoproteolytic cleavage of pp1a produces 11 non-structural proteins (nsp1-nsp11), while cleavage of pp1ab produces 15 non-structural proteins (nsp1-nsp10 and nsp12-nsp16). The functions of these nsps are partially understood. Particularly, the autoproteolytic cleavage relies on nsp3 (a papain-like proteinase) and nsp5 (the main proteinase), whereas the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is contained within nsp12 (Baker et al., 1993; Lu et al., 1995a) . Using the genomic RNA as a template, the replicase then synthesizes the negative sense genomic RNAs, which are used as templates for synthesizing progeny positive sense RNA genomes. On the other hand, through discontinuous transcription of the genome, the replicase synthesizes a nested set of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs; Sawicki et al., 2007) . Replication and transcription of the coronavirus genome involve the formation of the replication/transcription complexes (RTCs), which are anchored to the intracellular membranes via the multi-spanning transmembrane proteins nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 (Oostra et al., 2007) . Also, inside the infected cells, coronaviruses induce modification of the intracellular membrane network and formation of the double membrane vesicles (DMVs; Knoops et al., 2008) . Several studies have shown that the DMVs are closely associated with the coronavirus RTCs and the de novo synthesized viral RNAs (Gosert et al., 2002; Snijder et al., 2006) . The sgRNAs are translated into structural proteins and accessory proteins. Transmembrane structural proteins (S, M, and E) are synthesized, inserted, and folded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) . The N proteins are translated in the cytoplasm and encapsidate the nascent progeny genomic RNA to form the nucleocapsids. Virion assembly occurs in the ERGIC and is likely to be orchestrated by the M protein through protein-protein interactions (Masters, 2006) . The virions budded into the ERGIC are exported through secretory pathway in smooth-wall vesicles, which ultimately fuse with the plasma membrane and release the mature virus particles (Krijnse-Locker et al., 1994) . For some coronaviruses, a portion of the S protein escapes from viral assembly and is secreted to the plasma membrane. These S proteins cause fusion of the infected cell with neighboring uninfected cells, resulting in the formation of a large, multinucleated cell known as a syncytium, which enables the virus to spread without being released into the extracellular space (Masters, 2006) . In eukaryotic cells, ER is the major site for synthesis and folding of secreted and transmembrane proteins. The amount of protein entering the ER can vary substantially under different physiological states and environmental conditions. When protein synthesis surpasses the folding capacity, unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER and lead to ER stress. ER stress can also be activated by excessive lipids or pro-inflammatory cytokines (Kharroubi et al., 2004; Pineau et al., 2009) . To maintain homeostasis, cells have evolved signaling pathways that are collectively known as the unfolded protein response (UPR; Ron and Walter, 2007) . The UPR signaling starts with the unfolded proteins activating the three ER stress transducers: PKR-like ER protein kinase (PERK), activating transcriptional factor-6 (ATF6), or inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE1; Figure 2 ). Once activated, these sensors transmit the signal across the ER membrane to the cytosol and the nucleus, and the cell responds by lowering the protein synthesis and increasing the ER folding capacity. If homeostasis cannot be re-established, apoptosis is induced for the benefit of the entire organism (Tabas and Ron, 2011) . In this review, current studies on the involvement of the UPR in coronavirus infection and pathogenesis will be summarized. The role of UPR activation in host response, in particular the induction of apoptosis, will also be reviewed. Global proteomic and microarray analyses have shown that the expression of several genes related to the ER stress, such as glucoseregulated protein 94 (GRP94) and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78, also known as immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein, or BiP), is up-regulated in cells infected with SARS-CoV or in cells overexpressing the SARS-CoV S2 subunit (Jiang et al., 2005; Yeung et al., 2008) . Using a luciferase reporter system, Chan et al. (2006) found that both GRP94 and GRP78 were induced in SARS-CoV-infected FRhK4 cells. Consistently, the mRNA level of homocysteine-inducible, ER stress-inducible, ubiquitin-like domain member 1 (HERPUD1), an ER stress marker, was up-regulated in L cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) or SARS-CoV (Versteeg et al., 2007) . Data from this group have shown a similar induction of ER stress in IBV-infected Vero, H1299, and Huh-7 cells (unpublished observations). Although no parallel studies have been performed on Alphacoronaviruses, it is likely that all three genera of coronaviruses may induce ER stress in the infected cells. Current evidence suggests the following three main mechanisms. It is well-known that the replication of many plus-stranded RNA viruses induces modification of cellular membranes (Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008) . Among them, coronaviruses have been shown to induce the formation of DMVs in infected cells (David-Ferreira and Manaker, 1965) . Based on immunocytochemistry electron microscopy data, the DMVs co-localize with coronavirus major replicase proteins and are presumably the sites where coronavirus RTCs are located (Gosert et al., 2002; Snijder et al., 2006) . Indeed, DMVs are induced in HEK293T cells coexpressing the SARS-CoV nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6, which are all multispanning transmembrane non-structural proteins (Angelini et al., 2013) . There have been different perspectives regarding the origin of the coronavirus-induced DMVs. The late endosomes, autophagosomes, and the early secretary pathway have all been implicated as the membrane source of DMVs (van der Meer et al., 1999; Prentice et al., 2004; Verheije et al., 2008) . Also, co-localization has been observed between SARS-CoV nonstructural proteins and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), an ER marker (Snijder et al., 2006) . Using high-resolution electron tomography, Knoops et al. (2008) have shown that infection of SARS-CoV reorganizes the ER into a reticulovesicular network, which consists of convoluted membranes and interconnected DMVs. Recently, Reggiori et al. (2010) have proposed a model in which coronaviruses hijack the EDEMosomes to derive ER membrane for DMV formation. The EDEMosomes are COPIIindependent vesicles that export from the ER, which are normally used to fine-tune the level of ER degradation enhancer, mannosidase alpha-like 1 (EDEM1), a regulator of ER-associated degradation (ERAD; Calì et al., 2008) . It has been demonstrated that MHV infection causes accumulation of EDEM1 and osteosarcoma amplified 9 (OS-9, another EDEMosome cargo), and that both EDEM1 and OS-9 co-localize with the RTCs of MHV (Reggiori et al., 2010) . These results thus add mechanical evidence to support the ER-origin of the coronavirus-induced DMVs. Except for the N protein, all coronavirus structural proteins are transmembrane proteins synthesized in the ER. The M protein, which is the most abundant component of the virus particle, is known to undergo either O-linked (for most betacoronaviruses) www.frontiersin.org or N-linked (for all alpha-and gammacoronaviruses) glycosylation in the ER (Jacobs et al., 1986; Cavanagh and Davis, 1988; Nal et al., 2005) . The glycosylation of M protein is proposed to play a certain function in alpha interferon (IFN) induction and in vivo tissue tropism (Charley and Laude, 1988; Laude et al., 1992; de Haan et al., 2003) . The pre-glycosylated S monomers are around 128-160 kDa, whereas sizes can reach 150-200 kDa postglycosylation (exclusively N-linked), indicating that the S protein is highly glycosylated (Masters, 2006) . At least for transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), glycosylation is presumed to facilitate monomer folding and trimerization (Delmas and Laude, 1990) . Moreover, the glycans on SARS-CoV S proteins have been shown to bind C-type lectins DC-SIGN (dendritic cellspecific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin) and L-SIGN (liver lymph node-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin), which can serve as alternative receptors for SARS-CoV independent of the major receptor ACE2 (Han et al., 2007) . The folding, maturation, and assembly of the gigantic S trimeric glycoprotein rely heavily on the protein chaperons inside the ER, such as calnexin. In fact, the N-terminal part of the S2 domain of SARS-CoV S protein has been found to interact with calnexin, and knock-down of calnexin decreases the infectivity of pseudotyped lentivirus carrying the SARS-CoV S protein (Fukushi et al., 2012) . Also, treatment of αglucosidase inhibitors, which inhibit the interactions of calnexin with its substrates, dose dependently inhibits the incorporation of S into pseudovirus and suppresses SARS-CoV replication in cell cultures (Fukushi et al., 2012) . During coronavirus replication, massive amount of structural proteins is synthesized to assembly progeny virions. The production, folding, and modification of these proteins undoubtedly increase the workload of the ER. Budding of coronaviruses occurs in the ERGIC, which is a structural and functional continuance of the ER. Thus, the release of mature virions by exocytosis in effect depletes the lipid component of the ER. Taken together, coronavirus infection results in: (1) massive morphological rearrangement of the ER; (2) significant increase ER burden for protein synthesis, folding and modification; and (3) extensive depletion of ER lipid component. These factors together may contribute to the coronavirus-induced ER stress. In the following sections, the activation of the three individual branches of the UPR by coronavirus infection will be discussed in detail. The PERK branch of the UPR is believed to be activated first in response to ER stress (Szegezdi et al., 2006) . Activation of PERK begins with the dissociation from ER chaperon BiP, followed by oligomerization and auto-phosphorylation. Activated PERK then phosphorylates the α-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α). Phosphorylated eIF2α forms a stable complex with and inhibits the turnover of eIF2B, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that recycles inactive eIF2-GDP to active eIF2-GTP. This results in a general shutdown of cellular protein synthesis and reduces the protein flux into the ER (Ron and Walter, 2007) . Besides PERK, three other kinases are known to phosphorylate eIF2α, namely the protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR), heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI), and general control non-derepressible-2 (GCN2; Ron and Walter, 2007) . PKR is induced by IFN and activated by the binding of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) after virus infection (Clemens and Elia, 1997) . HRI is activated in red blood cells and hepatocytes by low levels of heme (McEwen et al., 2005) . GCN2 senses amino acid deficiency and is activated via binding to uncharged transfer RNAs (Sood et al., 2000) . Due to common outcome (eIF2α phosphorylation and translation suppression), activation of these kinases is collectively known as the integrated stress response (ISR; Ron and Walter, 2007) . Interestingly, the mRNAs of certain genes contain small ORFs in their 5 UTR and bypass the eIF2α-dependent translation block. One of these is the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), which is preferentially translated under ISR. ATF4 in turn transactivates genes involved in amino acid metabolism, redox reactions, and stress response. One of ATF4\\'s target genes is the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 153 (GADD153, also known as C/EBP homologous protein, or CHOP). GADD153 induces the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34), which recruits protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to dephosphorylate eIF2α and release the translation block. To this end, if ER stress is resolved, normal protein synthesis can be resumed. However, if ER stress persists, GADD153 can induce apoptosis by suppressing the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and inducing the pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death (Bim; Puthalakath et al., 2007) . GADD153 also activates ER oxidoreductin-1α (ERO1α), which encodes an ER oxidase. The increase protein influx to a hyper-oxidizing ER aggravates ER stress and induces apoptosis (Marciniak et al., 2004 ; Figure 3 ). Translation attenuation has been widely observed as a defensive mechanism of the host cells against viral infection. By reducing the translation of viral proteins, virus replication is hampered and the spread of infection is limited, giving enough time for the immune system to initiate effective antiviral responses. Among the four eIF2α kinases, PKR, due to its IFN-inducible nature and specific recognition of viral dsRNAs, plays an especially important role in inducing translation attenuation in virus-infected cells (He, 2006) . It is therefore not surprising that viruses have evolved various mechanisms to counteract PKR. For example, the non-structural 5A (NS5A) protein of hepatitis C virus directly interacts with the catalytic site of PKR, whereas the NS1 protein in the influenza A virus binds to dsRNAs and thus blocks PKR activation (Lu et al., 1995b; Gale et al., 1997) . During virus infection, massive production of viral proteins can overload the folding capacities of ER and lead to activation of another eIF2α kinase -PERK. Activation of PERK has been observed in cells infected with various DNA and RNA viruses, such as vesicular stomatitis virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), to name just a few (Jordan et al., 2002; Baltzis et al., 2004; Cheng et al., 2005) . However, similar to PKR, viruses have adopted counter measures to inhibit PERKmediated translation attenuation. For example, the E2 protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the glycoprotein gB of HSV1 bind to PERK and inhibit its kinase activity to rescue translation (Pavio et al., 2003; Mulvey et al., 2007) . There have been diverging results on the activation of PKR and/or PERK during coronavirus infection. In an early study, it has been found that there is minimal transcriptional activation of PKR and another IFN-stimulated gene, 2 5 -oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) in cells infected with MHV-1 (Zorzitto et al., 2006) . In a separate study, phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2α was also not observed in MHV A59-infected cells . However, Bechill et al. (2008) have detected significant eIF2α phosphorylation and up-regulation of ATF4 in cells infected with MHV A59, although no induction of GADD153 and GADD34 was observed. It has been suggested that due to the lack of GADD34-mediated eIF2α dephosphorylation, MHV infection induces sustained translation repression of most cellular proteins (Bechill et al., 2008) . However, the translation of MHV mRNAs seems to be resistant to eIF2α phosphorylation, and the detailed mechanisms for such evasion are yet to be investigated. As for SARS-CoV, PKR, PERK, and eIF2α phosphorylation are readily detectable in virus-infected cells (Krähling et al., 2009 ). However, knock-down of PKR using specific morpholino oligomers did not affect SARS-CoV-induced eIF2α phosphorylation but significantly inhibited SARS-CoVinduced apoptosis (Krähling et al., 2009) . It is possible that eIF2α is phosphorylated by PERK in SARS-CoV-infected cells, but similar loss-of-function experiments have not been performed, although overexpression of SARS-CoV accessory protein 3a has been shown to activate the PERK pathway (Minakshi et al., 2009) . The discrepancy regarding the activation of PKR/PERK during coronavirus infection may be a result from the different cell culture systems and virus strains used. The interpretation is further complicated by the IFN-inducible nature of PKR. It is generally believed that coronaviruses are poor type I IFN inducers in vitro (Garlinghouse et al., 1984; Spiegel et al., 2005; Roth-Cross et al., 2007) , although the IFN response may be essential for antiviral activities in vivo (Ireland et al., 2008) . Moreover, it is known that coronaviruses employ multiple mechanisms to antagonize the IFN response. For example, the nsp16 has been shown to utilize the 2 -O-methyltransferase activity to modify coronavirus mRNAs, so as to evade from the cytosolic RNA sensor melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and type I IFN induction (Roth-Cross et al., 2008; Züst et al., 2011) . Furthermore, the activities of several IFN-induced genes (ISGs) have also been shown to be modulated by coronaviruses during infection. For instance, Zhao et al. (2012) have demonstrated that the MHV accessory protein ns2 cleaves 2 ,5 -oligoadenylate, the product of www.frontiersin.org FIGURE 3 | Working model of PKR/PERK-eIF2α-ATF4-GADD153 pathway activation during coronavirus infection, using IBV as an example. Phosphorylation of eIF2α by PERK and PKR induces the expression of ATF4, ATF3, and GADD153. GADD153 exerts its pro-apoptotic activities via suppressing Bcl2 and ERKs by inducing TRIB3. The potential induction of DUSP1 by ATF3 may modulate phosphorylation of p38 and JNK, thus regulating IBV-induced apoptosis and cytokine production. The translation attenuation due to eIF2α activation can also lead to reduced inhibition of IκBα on NF-κB, which in turn promote cytokine production. Pointed arrows indicate activation, and blunt-ended lines indicate inhibition. The question mark indicates hypothetical mechanism. an ISG called OAS. This results in the suppression of the cellular endoribonuclease RNase L activity and facilitates virus replication in vitro and in vivo (Zhao et al., 2011 (Zhao et al., , 2012 . Thus, similar uncharacterized mechanisms may be used by MHV and other coronaviruses to block the activation and/or downstream signaling of PKR. In this regard, the activation of PERK via ER stress seems to be an alternative pathway to activate eIF2α, although coronaviruses may counteract by directly targeting eIF2α, as described below. Studies done by this group have shown that, phosphorylation of PKR, PERK, and eIF2α was detectable at early stage of IBV infection (0-8 hpi) but diminished quickly later (Wang et al., 2009; Liao et al., 2013) . The rapid de-phosphorylation of eIF2α is likely due to the accumulation of GADD34, which is a component of the PP1 complex and a downstream target gene induced by GADD153 (Wang et al., 2009 ). Despite of the rapid de-phosphorylation of eIF2α, significant induction of GADD153 was observed at late stage of infection (16-24 h) at both mRNA and protein levels (Liao et al., 2013) . The up-regulation of GADD153 was likely mediated by both PKR and PERK, since knock-down of either PKR or PERK by siRNA reduces IBV-induced GADD153 (Liao et al., 2013) . The up-regulation of GADD153 promotes apoptosis in IBV-infected cells, possibly via inducing the pro-apoptotic protein tribbles-related protein 3 (TRIB3) and suppressing the pro-survival kinase extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK; Liao et al., 2013) . Based on the findings so far obtained, it is safe to conclude that the PERK/PKR-eIF2α-ATF4-GADD153 pathway is activated by some, but not all, coronaviruses. In the infected cells, this pathway is activated at an early stage but quickly modulated by feedback de-phosphorylation. The PERK/PKR-eIF2α-ATF4-GADD153 most likely plays a pro-apoptotic function during coronavirus infection. Several recent studies have demonstrated the critical roles of cellular stress response pathways in modulating the innate immune activation (Cláudio et al., 2013) . One of the key regulators that bridge stress and innate immunity is GADD34, a negative regulator of eIF2α activation. It has been shown that when stimulated with polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid (polyI:C), the integrated stress response pathways were activated in dendritic cells (DCs), leading to up-regulation of ATF4 and GADD34 (Clavarino et al., 2012) . Interestingly, GADD34 expression did not significantly affect protein synthesis in DCs, but was shown to be crucial for the production of interferon β (IFN-β) and pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6; Clavarino et al., 2012) . In contrast, GADD34 has also been shown to specify PP1 to dephosphorylate the TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), thus negatively regulating the toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and pro-inflammatory cytokines [IL-6 and TNF-α (Tumor necrosis factor alpha)] production in macrophages (Gu et al., 2014) . The functional disparities of GADD34 in DCs and macrophages indicate that the integrated stress response may be regulated by some other signaling pathways, resulting in celltype specific outcomes in the innate immune activation. Since GADD34 induction was readily observed in cells infected with IBV (Wang et al., 2009 ), it will be intriguing to ask whether GADD34 also contributes to IBV-induced pro-inflammatory Frontiers in Microbiology | Virology cytokine production, and to determine potential cross-talks between the PERK pathway and innate immune activation during IBV infection. The massive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (cytokine storm) has been associated with the immunopathogenesis and high mortality rate of SARS-CoV (Perlman and Dandekar, 2005) . The transcription factor nuclear factor kappalight-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) is a master regulator of pro-inflammatory response and innate immunity (Hayden and Ghosh, 2012) . It has been well established that NF-κB is required for the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6 and IL-8) and the early expression of IFN-β during RNA virus infection (Libermann and Baltimore, 1990; Kunsch and Rosen, 1993; Wang et al., 2010; Balachandran and Beg, 2011; Basagoudanavar et al., 2011) . Interestingly, induction of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 has been detected in cells overexpressing the spike protein of SARS-CoV via the NF-κB pathway Dosch et al., 2009) . Thus, it is intriguing to consider the involvement of ER stress in activating the NF-κB pathway during coronavirus infection. In its inactive form, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by inhibitor of NF-κB alpha (IκBα), which masks the nuclear localization signal of NF-κB (Karin and Ben-Neriah, 2000) . The basal level of IκBα is maintained by constitutive synthesis and degradation of the protein (Kanarek et al., 2010) . Under various stress conditions, phosphorylation of eIF2α leads to global translation repression and a net decrease in IκBα protein level (Jiang et al., 2003) . This then results in the activation of NF-κB and induction of pro-inflammatory response (Figure 3) . Nonetheless, further studies are needed to characterize the actual contributions of ER stress in NF-κB-mediated cytokine induction during coronavirus infection. Previous study done by this group has shown that infection of IBV induced the production of IL-6 and IL-8, which was dependent on the phosphorylation of MAP kinase p38 (Liao et al., 2011) . Interestingly, a protein phosphatase called dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) was also up-regulated in IBV-infected cells and dephosphorylated p38 to modulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production (Liao et al., 2011) . Previous studies have shown that the mRNA and protein levels of DUSP1 are modulated by ER stress (Boutros et al., 2008; Li et al., 2011) . ER stress-induced DUSP1 up-regulation is likely to be mediated by ATF3 in the PERK pathway, since knock-down of ATF3 significantly reduced DUSP1 induction in cells under ER stress (Gora et al., 2010) . Thus, it is possible that IBV infection activates the PERK branch of UPR to induce DUSP1 expression, which in turn dephosphorylates p38 to modulate IBV-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production (Figure 3) . Besides p38, DUSP1 has also been shown to dephosphorylate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and ERK (Sun et al., 1993; Franklin and Kraft, 1997) . It has been long proposed that ERK phosphorylation promotes cell survival, whereas prolonged JNK and p38 phosphorylation is linked to the induction of apoptosis (Xia et al., 1995) . Thus, the induction of DUSP1 by ER stress in coronavirus-infected cells may also contribute to virus-induced apoptosis via modulation of the MAP kinase pathways. The IRE1-XBP1 branch of the UPR is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans. In response to unfolded proteins, IRE1 undergoes oligomerization . This results in trans-autophosphorylation of the kinase domain and the activation of IRE1\\'s RNase domain. So far, the only known substrate for IRE1 RNase activity is the mRNA of the X box binding protein 1 (XBP1) gene (Yoshida et al., 2001a; Calfon et al., 2002) . IRE1 cuts the XBP1 mRNA twice, removing a 26-nucleotide intron to form a frameshifted transcript, the spliced XBP1 (XBP1s). Whereas the unspliced XBP1 mRNA (XBP1u) encodes an inhibitor of the UPR, XBP1s encode a potent transcriptional activator, which translocates to the nucleus and enhances the expression of many UPR genes, including those encoding molecular chaperones and proteins contributing to ER-associated degradation (Ng et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2003 ; Figure 4) . Apart from the XBP1 pathway, activated IRE1 has been shown to recruit TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and induce apoptosis by activating the JNK (Urano et al., 2000) . This IRE1-JNK pathway is independent of IRE1\\'s RNase activity, but it requires IRE1\\'s kinase domain and involves TRAF2-dependent activation of caspase-12 (Yoneda et al., 2001) . Moreover, one recent study has demonstrated that the IRE1-JNK pathway is required for autophagy activation after pharmacological induction of ER stress. It was found that the kinase domain but not the RNase activity of IRE1 was required, and treatment of a JNK inhibitor (SP600125) abolished autophagosome formation after ER stress (Ogata et al., 2006) . Therefore, the IRE1 branch of UPR is closely associated with the JNK pathway and involved in JNK-mediated apoptosis and autophagy signaling. The involvement of IRE1-XBP1 pathway during coronavirus infection has been investigated by several studies, using MHV as a model. Either MHV infection or overexpression of the MHV S protein (but not other structural proteins) induces XBP1 mRNA splicing (Versteeg et al., 2007; Bechill et al., 2008) . However, although XBP1 mRNA is efficiently spliced, the protein product of spliced XBP1 cannot be detected in either the whole cell lysate or the nuclear fraction. Moreover, UPR downstream genes known to be activated by XBP1s, such as ER DNA J domain-containing protein 4 (ERdj4), EDEM1, and protein kinase inhibitor of 58 kDa (p58 IPK ), are not significantly induced after infection (Bechill et al., 2008) . Using a luciferase reporter system, it is shown that MHV infection does not inhibit transactivation of unfolded protein response element (UPRE) and ER stress response element (ERSE) promoter by XBP1s. Because MHV infection is associated with persistent eIF2α phosphorylation and host translational repression, it is likely that failure to translate the XBP1s protein may be the main reason why activation of the IRE1 branch does not occur even though XBP1 mRNA splicing is observed. On the other hand, although SARS-CoV belongs to the same genera of Betacoronavirus as MHV, neither infection with SARS-CoV nor overexpression of SARS-CoV S protein induces XBP1 mRNA splicing (Versteeg et al., 2007; DeDiego et al., 2011) . It is www.frontiersin.org FIGURE 4 | Working model of IRE1-XBP1 signaling pathway during coronavirus infection, using IBV as an example. IRE1 mediates XBP1 splicing, which up-regulates UPR target genes to restore ER stress, and the spliced XBP1 may also modulate the IFN and cytokine secretion. IRE1 activation modulates the phosphorylation of Akt and JNK, thus affecting IBV-induced apoptosis. IRE1 is also responsible for basal activity of IKK, which phosphorylates IκBα to remove its inhibition on NF-κB, thus facilitating the production of type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Pointed arrows indicate activation, and blunt-ended lines indicate inhibition. The question mark indicates hypothetical mechanism. possible that other viral proteins of SARS-CoV (such as the E protein mentioned below), function as an antagonist of IRE1-XBP1 activation. Result from this group has also shown that the IRE1-XBP1 pathway is activated in cells infected with IBV. In IBV-infected Vero cells, significant splicing of XBP1 mRNA was detected starting from 12 to 16 h post-infection till the late stage of infection. The mRNA levels of XBP1 effector genes (EDEM1, ERdj4, and p58 IPK ) were up-regulated in IBV-infected Vero cells. The activation of IRE1-XBP1 pathway was also detectable, though at a lower level, in other cell lines such as H1299 and Huh-7 cells. Treatment of IRE1 inhibitor effectively blocked IBV-induced XBP1 mRNA splicing and effector genes up-regulation in a dosage-dependent manner. Consistently, knockdown of IRE1 inhibited IBV-induced XBP1 mRNA splicing, whereas overexpression of wild-type IRE1 (but not its kinase dead or RNase domain deleted mutants) enhanced IBV-induced XBP1 mRNA splicing. These results suggest that the IRE1-XBP1 pathway is indeed activated in cells infected with IBV. Interestingly, an earlier onset and more significant apoptosis induction in IRE1-knockdown IBV-infected cells was observed, which is associated with hyper-phosphorylation of pro-apoptotic kinase JNK and hypo-phosphorylation of pro-survival kinase RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (Akt). Taken together, IRE1 may modulate IBV-induced apoptosis and serve as a survival factor during coronavirus infection. Interestingly, a recent report by DeDiego et al. (2011) demonstrates that the coronavirus E protein may modulate the IRE1-XBP1 pathway. Using a recombinant SARS-CoV that lacks the E protein (rSARS-CoV-E), it is found that both XBP1 splicing and induction of UPR genes significantly increase in the absence of E protein. Moreover, E protein also suppresses ER stress induced by RSV and drugs (thapsigargin and tunicamycin; DeDiego et al., 2011) . Whether the UPR modulating activity is related to the viroporin property of E protein remains to be investigated, but this study explains, at least in part, why SARS-CoV lacking the E protein is attenuated in animal models (Liao et al., 2004; DeDiego et al., 2007) . Notably, one recent study has demonstrated an alternative function of IRE1. It was found that at the late stage of ER stress, IRE1 mediates non-specific cleavage of membrane-associated mRNA species. This was dubbed IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) and was proposed to resolve ER stress by reducing the amount of transcripts influx (Hollien et al., 2009) . It is intriguing to think of RIDD as a host anti-viral mechanism. During prolonged ER stress induced by infection, non-specific RNase activity of IRE1 may decay the membrane associated viral mRNA. In fact, it has been recently suggested that RIDD is activated during Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection in Neuro2a cells (Bhattacharyya et al., 2014) . Interestingly, RIDD specifically degraded known target mRNA transcripts but not JEV RNAs. Also, treatment with IRE1 RNase activity inhibitor suppressed viral replication, indicating that JEV benefits from RIDD activation (Bhattacharyya et al., 2014) . Similarly to the integrated stress response, the IRE1 pathway has also been implicated in the innate immune response (Cláudio et al., 2013) . Martinon et al. (2010) have shown that in murine macrophages, the IRE1-XBP1 pathway is specifically activated by TLR4 and TLR2. Interestingly, the ER stress and TLR activation synergistically activate IRE1 and induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6 Frontiers in Microbiology | Virology (Martinon et al., 2010) . Consistently, Hu et al. (2011) have demonstrated that the IRE1-XBP1 pathway is also involved in IFN-β and pro-inflammatory cytokines production in murine DCs induced by polyI:C. Significantly, it has been shown that overexpression of the spliced form of XBP1 enhanced IFN-β production in DCs and significantly suppressed vesicular stomatitis virus infection (Hu et al., 2011) . Preliminary results from this group have also found that the activation of IRE1-XBP1 pathway is required for IL-8 induction in cells infected with IBV (unpublished data). On the other hand, the kinase but not the RNAse activity of IRE1 has been associated with ER-stress-induced NF-kB activation (Tam et al., 2012) . Under ER stress, IRE1 has been shown to phosphorylate TRAF2, which activates the IκB kinase (IKK) and contributes to its basal activity (Figure 4) . IKK in turn phosphorylates IκBα and promotes its proteasomal degradation, releasing NF-κB to activate downstream genes (Tam et al., 2012) . Taken together, these findings suggest that IRE1 may act synergistically with players in innate immunity and serve as a supplementary sensor and/or signaling factors during coronavirus infection. The ER stress sensor ATF6 has an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane segment and an ER luminal domain that sense the presence of unfolded/misfolded proteins. Under ER stress, ATF6 is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and cleaved by protease S1P and S2P (Haze et al., 1999) . The cleavage releases the cytosolic basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, which translocates into the nucleus and activates genes harboring the ERSE or ERSE II (Yoshida et al., 2001b) . The identified target genes of ATF6 include ER chaperones (such as GRP78, GRP94), PDI, and the UPR transcription factors GADD153 and XBP1 (Szegezdi et al., 2006) . Previously, it was proposed the ATF6 pathway is mainly pro-survival, as it enhances the ER protein folding capacity to counteract ER stress (Szegezdi et al., 2006) . However, recent studies have demonstrated that, under certain circumstances, ATF6-mediated signals may also contribute to ER-stress-induced apoptosis, possibly via activation of CHOP and/or suppression of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1; Gotoh et al., 2002; Nakanishi et al., 2005; Morishima et al., 2011) . The infection of cells by several viruses has been shown to activate the ATF6 pathway, including the Tick-borne encephalitic virus, African swine fever virus (ASFV), West Nile virus (WNV), and HCV (Ambrose and Mackenzie, 2011; Merquiol et al., 2011; Galindo et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2013) . In the case of ASFV, ATF6 activation has been shown to modulate ASFV-induced apoptosis and facilitate viral replication (Galindo et al., 2012) . For WNV, it has been shown that ATF6 activation promotes efficient WNV replication by suppressing signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) phosphorylation and late-phase IFN signaling (Ambrose and Mackenzie, 2013) . The NS4B protein of HCV has been shown to activate ATF6 signaling in cultured cells . Induction of chronic ER stress and adaptation of infected hepatocyte to UPR have been considered important for HCV persistent infection and pathogenesis in vivo (Asselah et al., 2010; Merquiol et al., 2011) . Compared with the PERK and IRE1 pathway, the induction of ATF6 pathway during coronaviruses infection has not been deeply investigated. In MHV-infected cells, significant cleavage of ATF6 could be detected starting from 7 h post-infection (Bechill et al., 2008) . However, the levels of both full length and cleaved ATF6 protein diminished at later time points during infection. Moreover, activation of ATF6 target genes was not observed at the mRNA level, as determined by luciferase reporter constructs under the control of ERSE promoters (Bechill et al., 2008) . It is also unlikely that MHV infection suppresses downstream signaling of the ATF6 pathway, because the reporter induction by overexpressed ATF6 was not inhibited by MHV infection. The authors thus conclude that global translation shutdown via eIF2α phosphorylation prevents accumulation of ATF6 and activation of ATF6 target genes (Bechill et al., 2008) . The involvement of ATF6 pathway during infection of other coronaviruses has not been well characterized. Although the spike proteins of coronaviruses have been considered as the major contributor in ER stress induction, overexpression of SARS-CoV spike protein fails to activate ATF6 reporter constructs (Chan et al., 2006) . On the other hand, the accessory protein 8ab of SARS-CoV has been identified to induce ATF6 activation (Sung et al., 2009 ). The 8ab protein was found in SARS-CoV isolated from animals and early human isolates. In SARS-CoV isolated from humans during the peak of the epidemic, there is a 29-nt deletion in the middle of ORF8, resulting in the splitting of ORF8 into two smaller ORFs, namely ORF8a and ORF8b, which encode two truncated polypeptides 8a and 8b (Guan et al., 2003) . ATF6 cleavage and nuclear translocation was observed in cells transfected with SARS-CoV 8ab (Sung et al., 2009 ). Physical interaction between 8ab and the luminal domain of ATF6 was also demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. However, similar experiments have not been performed for the 8a and 8b proteins. Also, further studies using recombinant SARS-CoV lacking 8a, 8b, or 8ab would be required. Coronaviruses constitute human and animal pathogens that are medically and economically important. Much remains unknown regarding the host-virus interactions during infection. Recent studies have demonstrated that coronaviruse infection induces ER stress in infected cells and activates the UPR. Activation of the PERK pathway (possibly in synergy with PKR and/or other integrated stress response kinases) leads to phosphorylation of eIF2α and a global translation shutdown. At late stage of infection, up-regulation of transcription factor GADD153 likely contributes to coronaviruses induced apoptosis. Activation of the IRE1 pathway induces XBP1 mRNA splicing and expression of downstream UPR genes. Interestingly, IRE1 but not XBP1 is also shown to modulate the JNK and Akt kinase activities, thus protecting infected cells from virus induced apoptosis. The ATF6 pathway is also activated in coronavirus-infected cells, resulting in the up-regulation of chaperon proteins to counteract ER stress. However, many questions remain to be addressed. First, although the coronaviruses spike proteins are demonstrated to induce ER stress and UPR, detailed mechanisms regarding www.frontiersin.org molecular interactions between the spike proteins and PERK/IRE1/ATF6 have not been determined. Second, it should be noted that the phenotypes observed in cells overexpressing viral proteins may not essentially reflect their physiological functions in the setting of a real infection. Further experiments using recombinant viruses with deletion of or modification in the target viral proteins should be performed to validate these findings (DeDiego et al., 2011) . Last but not the least, the three branches of UPR should not be considered functionally independent, but rather as an integrated regulatory network (Ron and Walter, 2007) . For example, besides being spliced by IRE1, XBP1 is also transcriptionally activated by PERK and ATF6 (Yoshida et al., 2001a; Calfon et al., 2002) . Also, it is difficult to separate the translation shutdown effect mediated by PERK and the induction of UPR genes by PERK and the other two ER stress sensors, as in the studies with MHV (Bechill et al., 2008) . Nonetheless, there are scientific and clinical significance for studies on ER stress and UPR induction during infection with coronaviruses and other viruses. As an evolutionarily conserved and well-characterized stress response pathway, it serves as a perfect model to study host-virus interactions and pathogenesis. Moreover, besides apoptosis, UPR has been recently demonstrated to crosstalk with other major cellular signaling pathways, including MAP kinases pathways, autophagy, and innate immune responses (Yoneda et al., 2001; Ogata et al., 2006; Martinon et al., 2010; Hu et al., 2011; Clavarino et al., 2012) . Thus, further investigations on coronavirus-induced UPR may also help identifying new targets for antiviral agents and developing more effective vaccines against coronaviruses.',\n",
              " \"In order to investigate the ability of an oil adjuvanted vaccine containing bovine coronavirus antigen to enhance lactogenic immunity in the calf, pregnant cows and heifers were vaccinated and specific virus neutralising antibody levels determined in serum, colostrum and milk. Pre-existing antibody titres (as a result of natural infection) in the serum of these animals were found to be significantly increased as a result of a single shot vaccination carried out between 2 and 12 weeks before calving. This was reflected in a similar increase in the titre and duration of specific antibody in milk and colostrum that was passed on to the calves. The overall response observed was highly dependent on an adequate antigen payload being incorporated within the single dose vaccine. No abnormal local or systemic reactions were observed as a result of vaccination. It is hoped that this approach will lead to the production of a superior commercial vaccine for the protection of neonatal calves against enteric coronavirus infection. Neonatal diarrhoea is a complex disease associated with a number of infectious agents occurring either singly or in combination [1, 2, 3] . In calves, economic losses are suered as a result of mortality, which can reach up to 80%, and also veterinary costs and decreased productivity of survivors. The viral agents most commonly associated with this syndrome are rotavirus and coronavirus, both of which have been shown to be primary pathogens in calves [4, 5] . Although this syndrome is most overtly associated with young animals, subclinical infections are also common in adults which may therefore act as reservoirs for reinfection [6] . Passive immunity against enteric viral infections is dependent upon the continual presence of a protective level of speci®c antibody in the gut lumen. This can be achieved by allowing the neonate to ingest colostrum or milk containing these speci®c antibodies from its dam (lactogenic immunity). Although most adult cattle are seropositive for both rotavirus and coronavirus antibodies [7] , during the transition from colostrum to milk production there is a dramatic decline in antibody titres which partially explains the high incidence of infection in calves older than 5 days. Successful rotavirus vaccines aimed at increasing both the titre and duration of speci®c antibody in both colostrum and milk have been developed [8] , however, similar success has not been reported with vaccines targeted against bovine coronavirus [9±13] . This paper reports the ability of a new single dose vaccine to signi®cantly increase both the level and duration of coronavirus neutralising antibodies in the serum and milk of vaccinated cattle. Bovine coronavirus was grown in mammalian cell culture. For antigen production, cell culture supernatant was harvested and clari®ed by low speed centrifugation. The virus was then inactivated by treatment with 0.0015 M binary ethyleneimine for 24 h at 378C. Finally, virus was concentrated up to 50-fold using a hollow ®bre ®ltration system with a 100,000 molecular weight cut-o. Bovine coronavirus antigen levels were determined by quantitative ELISA. Immulon 4 removawell strips (Dynex Technologies) were coated with an optimal concentration (previously determined by titration) of a sheep polyclonal anti-bovine coronavirus antibody diluted in 0.05 M carbonate±bicarbonate coating buffer of pH 9.6. After incubation at 378C for 1 h, the wells were blocked using PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 1% Tween 20 for 10 min at ambient temperature. 100 ml of PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 was added to each well followed by 50 ml of sample, standard or control. After incubation for 2 h at 378C on a shaker incubator the wells were washed three times using PBS containing 1% Tween 20. 200 ml of optimally diluted mouse monoclonal antibody speci®c for the virus haemagglutinin was then added to each well, followed by incubation for 1 h at 378C with shaking. After washing, 200 ml of an optimal concentration of a horseradish peroxidase -conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Nordic Immunologicals) was added to each well and incubated with shaking for a further 1 h at 378C. After washing, bound conjugate was visualised using o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) as the chromagen. After stopping the reaction using 2.5 M sulphuric acid, the optical density (492 nm) was proportional to the amount of bovine coronavirus antigen in the sample. Full quantitation up to a range of 100 antigen units per ml was achieved by including a set of six standards in each assay. The vaccine comprised of rotavirus and E coli K99 antigens from Rotavec K99 2 (Schering Plough Animal Health) plus inactivated bovine coronavirus antigen and was adjuvanted using a mineral oil based adjuvant. The aqueous and oil phases were prepared separately and combined prior to emulsi®cation using a Silverson homogeniser. Twelve maiden heifers of mixed breeds that had not previously been treated with vaccines containing coronavirus were housed indoors, bedded with straw, although access was given to a grass paddock for exercise. The animals were fed hay, silage and a standard cattle ration (Quinns of Baltinglass), water was available ad libitum. The health of all the animals was monitored by daily observation throughout the study. All the animals were bled 28 days prior to vaccination, serum prepared and the coronavirus antibody titre determined. The animals were ranked by descending antibody titre, and allocated into four groups of three animals each based on random assignment of one animal from each third of the ranking. Animals in groups 1 to 3 were immunised with 2 ml of the appropriate vaccine. Group 1, vaccine A containing 7. Vaccinated animals received a single 2 ml injection intramuscularly into the neck. All animals were bled before vaccination, 14, 28 and 84 days post vaccination, heifers in groups 2 and 3 were also bled at 112, 140 and 168 days post vaccination. Blood samples were stored for 12 h to allow clotting to occur, the serum separated by centrifugation, and stored at À208C prior to testing for bovine coronavirus (BCoV) antibodies by virus neutralisation and haemagglutination inhibition. These were carried out on four farms, two (studies A and B) were beef suckler herds and two (studies C and D) were dairy herds. A double blind trial design was used. Thirty cows on each farm were paired according to their expected calving dates and then randomly allocated to either vaccinate or placebo treatment groups (15 cows per group). Animals were included in the study on the basis that their expected calving dates fell between 2 and 12 weeks later than the day of vaccination. Animals were excluded only if unhealthy or where they were known to have been previously vaccinated against coronavirus. All animals received a single injection of 2 ml intramuscularly in the neck. Animals in the vaccinate group were immunised with a preparation containing 150 antigen units of coronavirus per dose, whilst animals in the control group were vaccinated with a saline/oil emulsion placebo containing none of the vaccine antigens. Rectal temperatures were taken from all animals either 2 days before vaccination (studies A and B) or immediately before vaccination (studies C and D), approximately 1 h after vaccination and 2 days after vaccination. On all sites, injection sites were examined for local reactions 1 day, 2 days and 14 days after vaccination. Calves from the beef suckler herds (studies A and B) were allowed unrestricted access to their dams for suckling. Calves from the dairy herds (studies C and D) were fed twice a day by hand with approximately 1.5 l of colostrum or milk from their own mothers for at least the ®rst 7 days of life. Blood samples were collected from all cows at intervals from pre-vaccination to post-calving as indicated in the results section. In studies A and B, milk samples from the dam and blood samples from the calf were collected at 7 day intervals from the day of calving (post-suckling) to 28 days post-calving, whilst in studies C and D samples were only taken on the day of calving (post-suckling) and three days post-calving. Blood samples were processed as described above. Colostrum or milk samples were stored at À208C prior to testing for the presence of BCoV neutralising antibody. Prior to testing, all sera were thawed, heat-treated at 568C for 30 min, sub-aliquoted and stored frozen at À208C until required. Colostrum and milk samples were thawed, centrifuged at 2000 Â g for 10 min and the heavy liquid fraction removed aseptically by a pipette to a clean sterile container. Sterile Rennet solution was then added to a concentration of 10% v/v and incubated for 1 h at 378C. The mixture was then centrifuged at 2000 Â g for 10 min and the upper liquid fraction (the whey) aseptically removed by pipette and dispensed into subaliquots of at least 0.5 ml before storage at À208C. Bovine coronavirus neutralising antibody responses were quanti®ed using a modi®cation of a standard plaque reduction assay [14] . Viral plaques were visualised by haemadsorption using 1% (w/v) rat red blood cells and the virus neutralising (VN) titre de®ned as the 50% end point following challenge with 40 plaque forming units of BCoV. Bovine coronavirus haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibodies were quanti®ed as follows. Test sera were ®rst pre-treated to remove non-speci®c agglutinins and inhibitors by incubation with an equal volume of 2% (w/v) rat red blood cells overnight at 2± 88C followed by treatment with 0.25% (w/v) potassium periodate for 30 min at room temperature. Standard HAI methodology was used, doubling dilutions (50 ml sample + 50 ml PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin) of test samples were carried out in`V' bottomed microwell plates. An equal volume of BCoV antigen containing four haemagglutinating units was then added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. 50 ml of 0.5% (w/v) rat red blood cells was then added and the test plates incubated overnight at 2± 88C. The haemagglutination antibody titre was de®ned as the reciprocal of the highest dilution giving 100% inhibition of agglutination, allowing for the pre-treatment dilution. All animals possessed some pre-existing antibody to bovine coronavirus as measured by both HAI (Range log 2 4±6 and VN (Range log 10 2X7±4X0). No de®ned increase in antibody titre could be detected by either HAI or VN in animals immunised with the lowest dose of BCoV (7.6 antigen units). However, animals receiving r38 antigen units of BCoV antigen showed an increase in mean HAI antibody titre by day 14. Peak HAI titres of log 2 7X7 and log 2 8X5 were observed either 84 days post-vaccination with 38 antigen units per dose, or 28 days post-vaccination with 190 antigen units per dose, respectively. These animals were maintained for 168 days and showed a steady drop in titre of approximately log 2 0X5 per month from day 84 (Fig. 1a) . The VN antibody response was similar but peaked earlier at day 14 with titres of approximately log 10 4X4X However, while VN antibody levels declined between days 28 and 84 in cattle receiving 38 antigen units (Fig. 1b) , those obtained from animals receiving the higher dose of 190 units did not decline until after day 84. Only the group immunised with 190 antigen units of BCoV still possessed a VN titre r1 log 10 above the pre-immunisation titre at 84 days post-vaccination (Fig. 1b) . The sentinel group showed no increase in antibodies to BCoV by either HAI or VN during the study. As a result of this study, a BCoV antigen load of 150 antigen units per dose was selected for further study on the basis that it was likely to produce an optimal antibody response in terms of antibody titre and duration. Vaccines for the cow/calf studies were therefore formulated at this level. The vaccine was well tolerated and no signi®cant local or systemic side eects were observed. The antibody results from these studies are shown in Fig. 2 . Since virus neutralisation is the key parameter involved in protection by lactogenic immunity, antibody titres were only determined by VN. With the exception of study B, the serum VN antibody levels of the placebo groups did not change signi®cantly during the course of the experiment. In study B however, 33% (5/15) of placebo treated animals showed an increase in serum VN antibody levels of log 10 0X5±1X0 during the experiment suggesting that`wild type' BCoV was circulating within the herd. After immunisation, serum VN antibody levels in the vaccinated groups showed a signi®cant p`0X05 increase in serum VN antibody levels compared with those observed in the placebo control groups. Mean serum VN antibody levels were increased by at least log 10 0X5 by 14 days post-vaccination and these levels were typically maintained until calving. Associated with this increase in serum VN antibody levels, ®rst day colostrum VN antibody was also signi®cantly higher log 10 0X5±0X8 in the test vaccine groups compared with the placebo control groups. Similar dierences were maintained in milk antibody throughout the period of study (up to day 4 on the dairy farms and up to day 28 on the beef suckler farms). The smallest increase occurred in study B where sero-conversion amongst the placebo treated animals was observed (Fig. 2b) . Serum taken from calves allowed to suckle vaccinated dams showed that levels of circulating VN antibody were up to ten-fold higher than those obtained from calves suckling placebo-vaccinated cows. The eect of the interval between vaccination and calving on the increase in milk VN antibody titre can be seen in Table 1 where data from studies A and B have been combined into ®ve sets, each set comprising 12 cows (three vaccinate and three placebo cows from each study) with mean vaccination/calving intervals of 19, 30, 46, 69 and 85 days, respectively. For placebo treated animals, irrespective of the vaccination/calving interval, day 0 colostrum possessed VN titres of ap- proximately log 10 4X0, falling rapidly to levels of approximately log 10 2X0 (background) in day 7 milk. In contrast, for the vaccinated cattle, day 0 colostrum possessed VN titres of approximately log 10 4X5, with a much slower reduction in antibody level, only approaching background levels in 28-day milk. The duration of the milk antibody response seen in the vaccinated animals where the vaccination/calving interval was 19 days was less marked than where this interval was longer. This re¯ects a reduced response to vaccination seen in approximately 50% of the vaccinates in the 19-day set. BCoV antigen input into the formulated vaccine was measured by ELISA, since measurements based on infectivity do not quantitate total antigenic mass, only viable virus particles and therefore could not be used post-inactivation. The ELISA procedure used was primarily targeted towards the viral haemagglutinin which has been shown to contain a key virus neutralising epitope [15] . Antigen levels could therefore be tracked throughout the formulation processes. The results of the dose response study indicate that in the presence of pre-existing antibody, relatively large amounts of immunogen (>38 antigen units) are needed to stimulate a signi®cant increase in BCoV serum antibody titre. There appear to be some minor dierences in the pattern of the antibody responses determined by either HAI or VN in that the HAI responses peak later than the VN responses. This may re¯ect dierences in antibody anity or sub-class requirements between the two methods of antibody measurement. In terms of neutralising antibody, the major eect of increasing antigen content appears to be in the duration rather than the magnitude of the response. With a vaccine dose containing 190 antigen units of antigen the response was rapid, reaching a plateau approximately 14 days post-vaccination which was maintained until at least 84 days post-vaccination. With a dose containing 38 antigen units of antigen, the virus neutralisation response was equally rapid and of similar magnitude, although in contrast declining rapidly to 84 days post-vaccination. Selection of the correct antigen load therefore appears critical in ensuring an optimal window in terms of the interval between vaccination and calving. An additional advantage in using a higher antigen dose was also demonstrated in cow / calf study B where elevated antibody responses were still observed even in the face of circulating infection. This suggests that vaccination could still play a signi®cant role in enhancing overall herd immunity even in an active disease situation. Fig. 2 . Mean BCoV VN antibody results in sera and milk from vaccinated (Q) and placebo treated (q) cows and sera from their respective calves. Studies were carried out on four farms, two beef suckler herds (a and b) and two dairy herds (c and d) and samples were obtained at vaccination (V), calving (C) or at the number of days indicated after the event. Error bars denote 95% con®dence limits. The main source of antibody in bovine mammary secretions is serum IgG 1 . This is selectively transferred from serum throughout lactation, albeit at a reduced level in milk compared to colostrum [16] . The initial serology data therefore suggested that with a BCoV antigen load of approximately 190 antigen units, successful vaccination could take place at any time between 2 and 12 weeks pre-calving. This hypothesis was supported by the observations on the magnitude of the antibody titres found in the colostrum and milk of cows vaccinated at dierent times pre-calving with a vaccine containing 150 antigen units of BCoV. Signi®cant responses in colostrum and milk were observed at both ends of the vaccination window, although not all cows vaccinated approximately 14 days pre-calving appeared to show an optimal response. Individually, there was a large variation in the levels of speci®c BCoV antibody present in both vaccinate and placebo control groups throughout the study. This variability was particularly noticeable in colostrum and milk samples, and presumably arose from the dierential levels of pre-existing BCoV antibodies observed in the animals. Although this would be expected to adversely aect the statistical testing of the results, signi®cant dierences p b 0X05 between test and control groups were found on the majority of days tested. This contrasts strongly with previously reported studies wherein increases in BCoV antibody titre in serum or milk following vaccination were either minimal or non-existent [9±13]. The reasons for the improved responses observed with the test vaccine are related both to the concentration of BCoV antigen present and the use of an oil adjuvant, which have generally been reported to be highly eective in the enhancement of rotavirus antibody titres in mammary secretions [8] . The magnitude of the antibody response observed following a single vaccination may be the result of the use of pre-primed (as a result of previous infection) cattle. Bovine coronavirus is ubiquitous and in the ®eld situation it is extremely dicult to ®nd a seronegative individual. This observation is supported by the data presented in this study where a total of 132 heifers and cows, with no previous BCoV vaccination history, were tested prior to treatment and all were found to have substantial levels of pre-existing antibody. A major decline in speci®c antibody levels present in mammary secretions was observed in the ®rst few days after calving. This is consistent with previously reported research [7, 17] , which showed that the switch from colostrum to milk was associated with a decrease in immunoglobulin concentration. Enhanced antibody levels are maintained for 21 to 28 days post-calving, although as BCoV speci®c antibody levels decrease calves will become more susceptible to sub-clinical infection. Such infections will stimulate active immunity and hence confer long term protection upon the calf. In the beef suckler situation, where the calf is allowed to suckle naturally from its dam, it is relatively easy to ensure the continual presence of protective antibody in the gut lumen. In the dairy situation, typically the calf is allowed access to colostrum but is prevented from suckling milk and thus fails to ensure the presence of protective antibody in the gut lumen beyond the ®rst few days after birth. A modi®ed feeding regimen is therefore required whereby colostrum Table 1 The eect of the interval between vaccination and calving on the magnitude of the BCoV VN antibody response in mammary secretions Mean log 10 BCoV VN antibody titre in colostrum/milk following vaccination at the speci®ed time before calving feeding is continued as part of the calves' diet for at least the ®rst 2 weeks of life. The levels of speci®c antibody present in the colostrum samples from the dairy herds (studies C and D) showed a marked drop in titre over 3 days, this was associated with the switch from colostrum to milk but may be further exacerbated by a dilution eect related to the larger volumes of milk produced by dairy cattle compared with beef cattle. These antibody levels were however signi®cantly higher than those in the placebo treated group and equivalent to those seen in milk from beef cattle at 7 days post-calving. Continued feeding of colostrum pooled from collections obtained during the ®rst 3 days post-calving should therefore provide an enhanced level of protection to the calf over this time period. It is accepted that by analogy with rotavirus infections in the calf [18] and transmissible gastro-enteritis virus infections in the piglet [19] , lactogenic immunity should protect against BCoV infection in the calf [20] , and this has been con®rmed experimentally (Crouch C.F., unpublished observation). There are however sig-ni®cant problems in assessing the ecacy of vaccines where protection is based on boosting lactogenic immunity. This is a result of the number of variables that interact to eect the apparent level of protection obtained. Such variables include the management system for the target animal, the titre of speci®c antibody achieved in both colostrum and milk, the duration of the enhanced antibody response, the volume and timing of antibody ingested and the nature (amount and pathogenicity) of the challenge. Of these, the key parameters able to be in¯uenced directly by the design of the vaccine are the titre and duration of speci®c antibody achieved in colostrum and milk. This report indicates that a single dose of coronavirus vaccine administered to the pregnant heifer 2 to 12 weeks before calving is capable of signi®cantly increasing the titre and duration of speci®c antibody present in colostrum and milk. Work is currently underway to con®rm the minimum level of speci®c antibody required to protect the calf from challenge and thus establish the duration of immunity.\",\n",
              " 'Maternally-derived passive immunity of infant mice to challenge infection with enterotropic coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain Y (MHV-Y) was studied. Pups born to both naive and immune dams, but nursed by naive foster dams, were susceptible to infection, while naive or immune pups nursed by immune foster dams were protected. The MHV infectious dose was identical among naive pups inoculated at 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks of age. Pups nursing immune dams resisted infection when inoculated at 1, 2, or 3 weeks of age. Three week old pups were protected only if they were allowed access to their immune dams. Pups born to MHV immune dams 4 in consecutive litters acquired equal MHV IgG titers in serum and whey and were all protected against challenge infection. Only pups actively ingesting immune whey at the time of or within two hours after virus inoculation were effectively protected. Pups born to dams immunized by oral inoculation with live MHV acquired both MHV-specific IgA and IgG in their whey, while pups born to dams immunized with killed virus acquired only IgG. Both IgA and IgG, but not IgG alone, were required for complete protection. Coronaviruses infect many mammalian and avian species, including humans. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), the coronavirus of mice, is a highly contagious and mutable virus with numerous antigenically cross-reactive but distinct strains. Like coronaviruses of other species, MHV strains can be divided according to their primary tissue tropism into respiratory and enterotropic strains [3] . Enterotropic MHV is the most common form of natural infection in contemporary mouse colonies, but is the least studied of the two MHV biotypes. It is thus important not only as a natural pathogen of laboratory mice but also as a potential model for enteric coronavirus infections of other species. Epizootics of enterotropic M H V in naive mouse colonies are associated with diarrhea and high mortality a m o n g infant mice. Mice in enzootically infected colonies, on the other hand, show no signs of disease, suggesting that maternallyderived passive immunity protects neonatal mice from disease and possibly even infection [1, 3, 7, 10] . We have previously shown that following an immunizing infection with enterotropic MHV-Y, dams produce MHV-specific IgA and IgG, but not IgM in their whey. Pups born to and nursed by M H V -Y immune dams acquire MHV-specific IgG in their serum and both IgA and IgG in their gastric contents I-9]. IgG can be transferred from mouse d a m to pup in utero via yolk sac receptors, as well as post-natally for two weeks through receptors located on the intestinal mucosa [6] . We have found that maternally-derived IgA is transferred to pups in whey and is restricted to the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract without absorption [9] . The purpose of the present study was to examine the protective effect of maternally-derived M H V antibody against challenge infection with enterotropic M H V and to delineate the role of different immunoglobulins in passively acquired challenge immunity. MHV-free outbred CDI(Crl-CD1Br) mice were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Portage, MI, shipped in filtered containers and housed in microisolator cages on pine shavings. Handling was performed aseptically in a biosafety change station as previously described [2] . Dams were immunized by a single oral inoculation with 10 3 median neonatal enteritis doses (NEDs0) of MHV-Y and bred to naive males after 10 days. Thus, pups were born on day 30 alter initial infection of their dams. Pups were inoculated orally with 103 NEDs0 MHV-Y. Interim blood samples from adult mice were obtained by periorbital bleeding under methoxyfturane anesthesia and terminal samples by cardiac puncture after euthanasia with carbon dioxide gas. Pups were killed and bled by decapitation. Whey was collected as previously described [9] . Tissues for histology were immersion-fixed in 10% neutral buffered saline, pH 7.2, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 lxm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Tissue sections were examined blindly and scored positive if the mucosa contained pathognomic MHV syncytia [1] . Tissues for virus assay were collected aseptically and frozen at -70 °C. MHV-Y was isolated in NCTC-1469 cells from naturally infected mice [1] , but because of its inefficient in vitro replication, it was propagated in infant CD 1 mice. Clarified intestinal homogenate, derived from infant mice at 48 hours after oral MHV-Y inoculation, was used as an inoculum. MHV-S was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Bethesda, MD and passaged in NCTC-1469 cells. MHV-3 was obtained from the Institut f/Jr Labortierkunde, Universit~t Zfirich, Switzerland and passaged in NCTC-1469 cells. Because of the insensitivity of cell culture for detection and propagation of enterotropic MHV-Y, infectious virus in tissue samples was determined with an infant mouse bioassay. Tissues for virus assay were thawed, weighed and homogenized in glass grinders as 10% w/v suspensions in minimal essential containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Four 2 day old mice were inoculated orally with 10~t suspension and at 48 h after inoculation, ascending 37 colons were blindly examined microscopically for MHV lesions (syncytia, ne, crosis, inflammation), as previously described [1] . A sample was considered positive if at least 1 of 4 bioassay pups had enteritis. Pilot studies have determined that MHV-Y enteric lesions are at their zenith in the ascending colon at 48 h, but direct contact littermates do not yet have lesions at this interval. Thus, inoculation with multiple samples could be accomplished using a single litter differentially marked with ink. Since enterotropic MHV-Y does not replicate efficiently in cell culture [1, 3] , immunoassays with respiratory MHV strains as antigens were used. Serum and whey were tested for MHVspecific IgG by an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with MHV-S infected NCTC-1469 cells [13] and for IgA by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using purified MHV-3 as antigen [8, 9] . Sentinel animals were screened for inadvertant MHV infection by an indirect immunofluorescence assay [12] . The protective effect of passive immunity against challenge infection was first examined. Pups born to MHV-Y immune or naive dams were allowed to suckle their natural dams for six days, then transferred to immune of naive foster dams. Two days after transfer, all pups were challenged orally with MHV-Y, necropsied 48 h later and ascending colons examined for microscopic evidence of enteritis. Naive pups nursed by naive foster dams all developed enteritis (9/ 9) and naive pups nursed by immune dams showed no signs of disease (0/9) ()~2p ~< 0.001). On the other hand, immune pups transferred to immune foster dams were protected from disease (0/13) whereas all immune pups suckling naive foster dams had enteritis (13/13) (Z2p ~ 0.001). Pups nursing MHV-Y immune dams have intraluminal IgG and IgA to M H V in their gastrointestinal tracts for the first two weeks, but not at weaning age [9] . To evaluate how this change affects protection against infection with enterotropic MHV, pups born to immune and naive dams were challenged at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks of age with serial 10-fold dilution doses (101-105 NEDs0) of MHV-Y. They were necropsied at 48 h; serum was collected for EIA and ascending colon samples were collected for histology and virus assay. Based upon both histological evidence of enteritis and detectable virus, different aged pups from naive dams were susceptible to approximately the same infectious dose of MHV-Y (Table 1) . One and two week old pups suckling immune dams were fully protected against infection, even when inoculated with 105 NEDs0 MHV-Y. Unweaned three week old pups of immune dams required a higher infectious virus dose to develop enteritis and detectable virus compared to weaned three and four week old mice, which were as susceptible to MHV-Y infection as non-immune animals of the same age-group ( [9] . To examine if the same is true for intraluminal antibody in the gastrointestinal tract and how it affects protection against challenge infection, pups of the first four litters born to immune and naive dams were inoculated with M H V -Y at one week of age and necropsied 48 h later. Whey and serum were collected for E I A / E L I S A and ascending colon for histology. Since by infecting the pups, dams would become superinfected or boosted immunologically, a separate group of dams was used to evaluate each litter. Naive males were used as sentinels throughout the experiment to detect accidental booster infections with MHV, and none were detected. IgG titers in serum and whey of seven day old pups did not decrease significantly over the course of four consecutive litters ( Table 2 ) . The pups\\' M H V IgG titers were, however, dependent u p o n their dams\\' serum M H V IgG titer. M H V IgA titers in the whey seemed to decrease slightly from the first to the fourth litter, but pups from all four litters born to immune dams were completely protected from enteritis after challenge with M H V -Y ( Table 2 ). The next experiment studied the effect of lactogenic passive antibody on ongoing infections with MHV-Y. One week old pups born to i m m u n e or naive dams were inoculated with M H V -Y and transferred to naive or immune dams, respectively, at -24, -12, -2, 0, + 2, + 12, or + 24h relative to inoculation. They were necropsied 48 h after infection and infection status was assessed by histology and virus bioassay of ascending colon samples from each mouse. Pups from i m m u n e dams transferred to naive foster dams at or after the time of inoculation, but not before, were protected from M H V -Y infection, based u p o n lack of enteritis and no detectable virus. Pups from naive dams transferred to immune foster dams before or within 2 h after inoculation, but not thereafter, Immune pups/naive foster dams 7/11 a 7/t0 5/12 0/9 0/9 0/11 0/12 Naive pups/immune foster dams 0/5 0/9 0/6 3/10 8/12 \"Number of pups with enteritis/number examined were also protected ( Table 3) . These results suggest the importance of active ingestion of whey for protection against infection. A final experiment attempted to evaluate the importance of the different immunoglobulin classes involved in passive immunity. Adult female mice were immunized intraperitoneally eight times at intervals of five days with formalininactivated MHV-Y, according to a previous protocol [10] which caused t h e m to produce IgG but not IgA against MHV, which was confirmed by EIA/ ELISA. They were bred and allowed to whelp. At one week of age, the pups were challenged with M H V -Y and necropsied 48 h later. Serum and whey were collected for E I A / E L I S A and ascending colon samples for histology and virus assay. Reciprocal geometric mean serum EIA M H V IgG titers of nine dams (3456 :t: 1499 SD) were lower than those of orally infected animals, but comparable to dams having their third or fourth litter ( Table 2 ). The same was true for M H V IgG titers in pup serum (1600 + 883) and whey (141 + 51). No M H V IgA could be detected in any of the samples. Ascending colon histology of pups from 10 different litters (81 pups total) revealed mild nonspecific inflammation (enteritis) in many of the pups, but most cases could not be scored positive due to lack of pathognomonic syncytia. Five of the pups (representing 4 litters) had mild enteritis with demonstrable syncytia which could be definitively scored positive. Syncytia were very rare and less conspicuous in these mice compared to MHV-Y infected, naive mice ( Figs. 1 and 2) . Furthermore, virus could be detected in only 1 of 11 samples tested, including colons from 2 individual pups of 1 litter and pooled colon samples from each of 9 different litters. One pooled Fig. 1 . Ascending colonic mucosa of a nine day old mouse suckling a dam vaccinated with inactivated MHV-Y, 48 h after oral MHV-Y callenge. The mucosa is nearly normal, with a single small virus-induced syncytium (arrow) in the surface mucosa Fig. 2 . Ascending colonic mucosa of a nine day old mouse suckling a non-immune dam, 48 h after oral MHV-Y challenge. The mucosa has multiple virus-induced syncytia (arrows), the lamina propria is infiltrated with leukocytes and mucin vacuoles in goblet cells are less prominent than normal sample from 1 of the litters was positive. These results indicated no or low levels of replicating virus in these pups. Previous studies, using dams immunized oronasally or intraperitoneally with live respiratory MHV strain JHM [5, 11] or parenterally with inactivated enterotropic MHV strain DVIM [10] showed that maternally-derived passive immunity was capable of preventing death in pups challenged with the respective strain of MHV. These findings were confirmed in the present study with dams that were actively immunized by oral inoculation with enterotropic MHV-Y. This immunization procedure was chosen because it closely mimics the natural infection. Pups born to and nursed by dams that were immunized in this fashion were not only protected from fatal diarrhea, but we also showed they were protected from microscopic evidence of enteritis and were virus-free, based on bioassay of intestinal samples. Cross-foster nursing experiments showed that only the immune status of the dam nursing the pups at the time of infection was relevant for the pups\\' protection. The pups\\' systemic serum antibody had no effect on virus replication in their intestine. Passive immunity to enterotropic MHV seemed therefore to be solely dependent on intraluminal MHV IgA and IgG in the gastrointestinal tract of the pups. Furthermore, only intraluminal antibody present at the exact time of infection or up to two hours afterwards was able to neutralize the challenge virus and prevent enteritis and virus replication. In contrast, similar studies with respiratory MHV-JHM have shown that pasive immunity to challenge infection can be conferred by transfer of maternal IgG, and is not dependent upon active ingestion of whey at the time virus challenge [5] . The effectiveness of intraluminal antibody on neutralizing enterotropic MHV was underscored by another observation. Due to the change from milk to solid food at weaning age, pups nursed by immune dams had no detectable MHV-specific antibody in their gastrointestinal tract at that time [9] . When three week old pups from immune dams were challenged with MHV-Y, the group that had been separated from their dam at the time of infection was as susceptible to MHV-Y infection as pups from naive dams of the same age group, but three week old pups that were still suckling their immune dams were less susceptible to infection. Even in undetectable quantities, intraluminal antibody in the gastrointestinal tract of pups suckling immune dams seemed to be able to neutralize low titers of challenge virus. Only pups up to one week of age develop severe or fatal disease when infected with enterotropic MHV-Y [4] . Older pups and adults do not usually develop apparent disease. This study was able to show that this age-related tendency to fatal diarrhea was not due to an increased susceptibility to enterotropic MHV infection, since all naive pups between one and four weeks of age were equally susceptible to the same infectious dose of MHV-Y, resulting in both enteritis and active virus infection. Pups suckling immune dams were fully protected against virus challenge for the first two weeks postpartum. This would explain why no apparent disease occurs among pups in enzootically infected mouse colonies. Maternally-derived passive immunity protects pups during the critical first two weeks of their lives. In enzootically infected colonies, pups most likely become infected at weaning or shortly thereafter, at an age when maternally derived antibody wanes and susceptibility to disease is minimal. Most mice in commercial breeding colonies give birth to less than eight litters during their lives. Since the protective effect of maternally-derived passive immunity to enterotropic MHV did not diminish over the course of four consecutive litters, one can speculate that immunity caused by the initial infection might effectively protect all pups subsequently born to these animals from fatal diarrhea when infected with the same strain of virus. The present study confirmed previous findings that mice immunized orally with infectious MHV-Y produced virus specific IgG and IgA [9] , but mice immunized parenterally with inactivated MHV produced only IgG [10] , since the mucosal component of the immune response was missing. When pups nursed by dams immunized using these different means were challenged orally with MHV-Y, the group that received both IgG and IgA in milk was fully protected, based upon both histology and infectious virus assay. Pups that received only IgG in their milk had evidence of protection against virus challenge, but a few developed mild nonspecific enteritis and those that could be confirmed to be definitely infected based upon the presence of MHV syncytia of enterocytes or demonstrable infectious virus had very mild disease. It can therefore be concluded that while MHV-Y specific IgG has neutralizing capacity, IgA is needed for complete protection from infection. These studies provide evidence that maternally-derived passive immunity to an enterotropic virus infection requires continuous, active ingestion of immune whey for effective protection. The laboratory mouse is host to two enterotropic viruses, coronavirus and rotavirus, which may be useful models for examining pathogenetic mechanisms of enterotropic viruses which cause neonatal disease in other species, including humans.',\n",
              " \"The duration of challenge resistance in mice immunized with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain JHM was examined as a model of immunity to corona-virus infection. Genetically susceptible BALB/cByJ mice were immunized by intranasal (i.n.) or per os (p.o.) inoculation with MHV-JHM or sterile tissue culture fluid (sham) then challenged i.n. with MHV-JHM or sterile tissue culture fluid 1, 6, or 12 months later. Four days after challenge, virus in nasal turbinates and liver was quantified, and prevalance of microscopic lesions in liver and gut-associated lymphoid tissue was tabulated as indices of challenge resistance. MHV-immunized and challenged groups were compared to sham-immunized and challenged groups. Mice immunized by i.n. inoculation were strongly resistant to challenge at 1, 6, and 12 months. Mice immunized by p.o. inoculation were resistant at 1 month, but became partially susceptible to reinfection at 6 and 12 months, based upon all indices. These data indicate that, depending upon route of immunization, mice can become susceptible to reinfection with the same coronavirus strain over time. Coronaviruses represent a large family of respiratory and enteric pathogens of a broad range of mammalian and avian hosts. In humans, respiratory coronaviruses are implicated as the cause of approximately 15 to 20% of common colds [6, 10] . The frequency of coronavirus colds suggests that individuals can be repeatedly infected with coronaviruses. If repeated infections take place in a single individual, immunity is either ineffective, short-lived or virus strainspecific. The murine coronavirus MHV has been a useful model system to study coronavirus-host interactions. Using MHV strains with primary respiratory tropism, it has been shown that mice recovered from an i.n. inoculation of MHV resisted i.n. challenge with the homologous MHV strain, but were fully susceptible to challenge with a different MHV strain one month after the immunizing infection [4] . These data support the contention that i.n. challenge immunity to coronavirus is effective following an i.n. immunizing infection, but that it appears to be highly virus-strain specific, in spite of close antigenic relationships among coronavirus strains and between certain coronavirus types [6] . The other possible mechanism for repeated infection, which has not been explored, is an immune response that is short-lived. The purpose of this study was to critically examine the duration of host challenge immunity against the same coronavirus strain, using a MHV-mouse model. Challenge immunity to a single strain of coronavirus was evaluated with MHV-JHM in genetically susceptible BALB/cByJ mice. Following i.n. inoculation of BALB/cByJ mice, it has been shown that MHV-JHM initially replicates in nasal mucosa, then disseminates by viremia to internal organs including liver between days 3-5 after inoculation [3] . Unpublished observations have also revealed that gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is an early target and potential portal of entry for MHV-JHM. The experimental plan was designed around these features. Mice were immunized by i.n. or p.o. inoculation with MHV-JHM or sterile tissue culture fluid (sham). At 1, 6, or 12 months after immunizing infection, mice were challenged i.n. with the same stock of MHV-JHM that was used for immunization, or sham-challenged. Resistance to challenge was evaluated by virus quantification in nasal turbinates and liver and by histology of liver and GALT on day 4 after challenge. Histology was not performed on nose, since turbinates were destroyed for virus assay. Antibody titers to MHV-JHM were also evaluated. Three week-old inbred BALB/cByJ (BALB) and pregnant outbred CR 1 :CD 1 BR (CD 1) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory', Bar Harbor, ME and Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Portage, MI, respectively. Mice from both sources were certified MHV-free by the vendors and verified as such serologically at this institution. Mice were shipped in filtered boxes and transferred upon arrival into autoclaved Micro-isolator containment cages (Lab Products, Maywood, N J), containing wood shavings, food (Prolab Animal Diet, Agway, Syracuse, NY) and water. To preclude natural contamination with MHV and other pathogens during the l-year study period, autoclaved cages were changed under strict protocol in a class II biological containment cabinet. Pathogen-free sentinel mice were maintained in adjacent cages and tested periodically for serum antibody to murine viruses. Based upon serology, contamination of sentinel mice and sham-inoculated control mice did not take place during this study. Mice were assigned randomly to treatment groups, given i.n. or p.o. immunizing infections with MHV-JHM or tissue culture fluid, then held for 1, 6, or 12 months, at which time they were challenged i.n. with MHV-JHM or tissue culture fluid. At 4 days after challenge, mice were killed with carbon dioxide gas then exsanguinated by cardiocentesis. Nasal turbinate, liver and serum were collected and frozen at -70 °C until tested for virus or antibody. Liver and GALT (Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes) were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, pH 7.2, paraffin embedded, and processed by routine histological methods. MHV-JHM was obtained and maintained as previously described [3] . Mice were inoculated i.n. or p.o. with 20 pl of cell-free culture fluid containing approximately 103TCIDs0 of MHV-JHM. Virus in nasal turbinates and liver was quantified by intracerebrat inoculation of neonatal CD 1 mice with serial 10-fold dilutions of 10% (w/v) tissue homogenates [3] and expressed as logl0LDs0/gram. Serum antibody titers to MHV-JHM were determined with an enzyme immunoassay using formalin-fixed MHV-JHM-infected 17 C11 cells as antigen, as previously described [9] . Sera from sentinel mice and sera from experimental mice were screened for MHV antibody with an indirect immunofluorescence assay [8] . A number of p.o. MHV-JHM immunized mice were found to be seronegative. These mice were considered uninfected and eliminated from treatment groups. All other MHV immunized mice were seropositive and shamimmunized mice were seronegative. Virus titers were compared between treatment groups with Student's unpaired t test and prevalence data were compared by Chi-square analysis. Based on virological indices, mice immunized i.n. with MHV-JHM remained highly resistant to i.n. MHV-JHM challenge through 12 months. Mice immunized p.o. with MHV-JHM were resistant to challenge at t month, but became partially susceptible to i.n. MHV-JHM challenge after 6 and 12 months ( Fig. 1 a, b) . Titration of virus in nasal turbinates, the primary target for MHV-JHM, indicated high titers of MHV-JHM in sham-immunized mice challenged at 1, 6, and 12 months (Fig. 1 a) . In contrast, none of the nasal turbinates from the i.n. MHV-JHM-immunized mice had detectable virus after challenge at 1, 6, or 12 months. Among 19 mice immunized p.o. with MHV-JHM, only 1 had detectable virus in nose when challenged at 1 month, 2 of 6 mice had detectable virus when challenged at 6 months, and 3 of 6 mice had detectable virus when challenged at 12 months. Both prevalence of nasal lesions (P~<0.05) and virus titers (P~<0.05) were significantly higher at 12 months compared to 1 month after immunization in these mice. No virus was detected in noses of shamimmunized/sham-challenged or p.o. MHV-JHM-immunized/sham challenged mice at 1, 6, or 12 months. Virus titration of liver, a secondary target for MHV-JHM which becomes infected following initial replication in nose, revealed similar findings (Fig. 1 b) . High titers of virus were detected in liver of shamimmunized mice challenged i.n. with MHV-JHM at 1, 6, and 12 months. Liver virus titers among sham-immunized/MHV-JHM-challenged mice became higher as mice aged, with significantly higher titers in mice challenged after 12 months compared to 1 month (P~<0.001). Mice immunized i.n. with MHV-JHM generally had no detectable liver virus after challenge with MHV-JHM at 1, 6, or 12 months, except for 1 of 16 mice with low titered virus at the 6 month interval. Mice immunized p.o. with MHV-JHM had no detectable liver virus after challenge 1 month later, but 6 of 16 mice were positive after challenge at 6 months and 3 of 6 mice were positive after challenge at 12 months. Mice (Table 1) . Liver lesions consisted of focal or multifocal areas of hepatocellular necrosis, accompanied by infiltration with a mixture of leukocytes as described I-31. Occasional mice had such lesions in the absence of detectable virus. This may have been due to the nonspecific nature of these lesions, which can occur in low prevalence in aging mice due to noninfectious causes such as ischemia [5] . GALT lesions consisted of acute necrosis of lymphocytes, lymphocytic syncytia and necrosis of dome enterocytes (M cells). Mice immunized i.n. with MHV-JHM had no or few lesions after challenge at 1, 6, or 12 months. Mice immunized p.o. with MHV-JHM had no lesions in liver or GALT after challenge 1 month later, but p.o.-immunized mice had a significantly higher prevalence (P ~< 0.05-0.001) of liver and GALT lesions challenged at 6 and 12 month compared to mice challenged at 1 month. Serum antibody titers to MHV-JHM indicated that previously immunized mice, regardless of route of immunization, maintained equivalent high levels of antibody at 1, 6, or 12 months ( Table 2 ). Susceptibility to reinfection in p.o.immunized mice was not correlated with reduced antibody titer. Mice that recovered from an i.n. or p.o. immunizing MHV infection resisted i.n. challenge with the same coronavirus strain for up to 12 months, but route of immunization affected the duration and degree of resistance. Immunization by i.n. infection conferred nearly absolute challenge resistance. Immunization by p.o2 infection induced absolute challenge resistance at 1 month, but mice were partially susceptible to reinfection when challenged at 6 or 12 months. Thus, under these circumstance, recovered mice can be actively reinfected with the same MHV strain and potentially serve as a subclinical source of transmission to other mice. On the other hand, previous studies have shown i.n. immunization of mice to one strain of MHV confers i.n. challenge resistance to that homologous MHV strain, but mice are fully susceptible to infection with a different MHV strain [4] . These studies collectively demonstrate that challenge resistance to coronavirus (MHV) is initially strong, but is virus strainspecific and may deteriorate with time. It might be presumed that i.n. immunization closely mimics natural infection, since the primary mucosal target for MHV-JHM is nasal mucosa [1, 2, 3] . In fact, p.o. immunization may more closely parallel natural infection. Intranasal inoculation of several MHV strains has been shown to result in infection that extends deeply into the nasal cavity, involving olfactory mucosa and resulting in a high prevalence of brain infection by extension along olfactory nerves [ 1, 2] . In contrast, oral MHV inoculation results in infection of the anterior nasal cavity [2] , probably by reflux up the incisive foramina, which communicate between the oral cavity and anterior nose [7] . Brain infection does not occur following p.o. inoculation of MHV in adult mice. Likewise, brain infection is exceedingly rare among experimental mice exposed to MHV by direct contact with infected mice and among naturally exposed mice [unpublished observation]. It is thus likely that natural exposure to MHV results in infection of the anterior nares, analogous to experimental p.o. inoculation. This was our logic in examining both routes of immunization. The mechanisms for the differences between mice immunized i.n. vs. p.o. are unclear. As noted above, i.n. inoculation results in more widespread and deeper infection of the nasal respiratory and olfactory mucosa, as well as a high prevalence of brain infection through olfactory tracts. Thus, mucosal epithelium may receive a higher antigenic stimulus or recovery from brain infection may result in a greater immune response compared to p.o.-immunized mice. Whatever the mechanism, antibody titers to MHV did not differ between p.o.-and i.n.-immunized mice at 1, 6, or 12 months.\",\n",
              " 'Coronaviruses (CoVs) comprise a polymorphic group of respiratory viruses causing acute inflammatory diseases in domestic and agricultural animals (chicken, pig, buffalo, cat, dog) Until recently, this infection in humans was mainly observed during the autumn-winter period and characterized by a mild, often asymptomatic, course The situation changed dramatically in 2003, when SARS outbreak caused by pathogenic CoV (SARS-CoV) was recorded in China A decade later, a new CoV outbreak occurred in the form of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), whereas in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) cases were recorded, which transformed within the first months of 2020 into the pandemic In all three cases, CoV disease led to severe bronchopulmonary lesions, varying from dry, debilitating cough to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) At the same time, multiple changes in innate immunity were noted most often manifested as a pronounced inflammatory reaction in the lower respiratory tract, featured by damaged type II pneumocytes, apoptosis, hyalinization of alveolar membranes, focal or generalized pulmonary edema Destructive processes in the respiratory tract were accompanied by migration of monocytes/macrophages and granulocyte neutrophils to the inflammatory focus Such events were accompanied by production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which magnitude could ascend up to a cytokine storm SARS-CoV is characterized by symptoms of secondary immunosuppression, manifested by the late onset of interferon production and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes â€“ the key inflammatory factor The reason for such reaction may be accounted for by CoV arsenal containing extensive set of structural and inflammatory proteins exerting pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties Delayed IFN production allowed CoV to replicate actively and freely, and when type I IFN synthesis was eventually triggered, its activity was detrimental and accompanied by an aggravated infection course Thus, SARS can surely be referred to immune-dependent infections with a marked immunopathological component The purpose of this review was to describe some mechanisms underlying formation of innate immune response to infection caused by pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) ;ÐšÐ¾Ñ€Ð¾Ð½Ð°Ð²Ð¸Ñ€ÑƒÑ\\x81Ñ‹

              " 'Two major forms of immune defense are activated once a virus has breached a natural barrier to entry, innate and adaptive immunity. This chapter deals with the innate immune response, a mechanism that operates immediately to limit tissue injury and prevent the spread of virus to adjacent, healthy cells, the so-called “bystander” effect. Innate immunity is of broad specificity, modulated largely by the secretion of an extensive array of signaling molecules that collectively form local inflammatory responses. Almost all viruses have developed elaborate strategies to circumvent host innate immunity. Some viruses use the host innate response as a vital part of the replication cycle, for example by taking advantage of innate responses the number of cell surface viral receptors may increase or use of an expanded endoplasmic reticulum for virus assembly. A virus invading the host must first breach natural barriers at the portal of entry. These may include (1) the physical barrier of the skin or the epithelial lining of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, or urogenital tract, (2) secretions at mucosal surfaces, for example, the surfactant and mucociliary functions of the respiratory tract, or the mucus, acid and detergent (bile) environment of the gastrointestinal tract. Two major forms of immune defense then operate after an incoming virus has penetrated these physiological and anatomical barriers (Table 5 .1). The first, innate immunity, is a mechanism that is continually present and operates immediately to limit tissue injury and prevent the spread of virus to adjacent, healthy cells, the so-called bystander effect. This innate response is of broad specificity, modulated largely by the secretion of an extensive array of signaling molecules (lymphokines, cytokines, etc.) , and forms the basis of any immediate localized inflammatory response. In contrast, the adaptive immune response is pathogen-specific and requires more time to develop; it also generates long-term pathogen-specific memory that is the basis for a more rapid immune response and enhanced protection should the same pathogen be encountered again at a later date. Although it is convenient to consider innate and adaptive responses as distinct responses to virus infection, many aspects of the initial innate response play a continuing role in later immune processes and thus the distinction between responses based on broad, non-specific recognition of viruses and specific recognition by immune cells is becoming increasingly blurred as more becomes known, especially in regard to cell signaling pathways. In short, the development of a robust adaptive immune response to an invading virus is intimately linked to the early innate response to infection. Since the last edition of this book, it has become apparent that most, if not all, viruses of humans have evolved ways to circumvent the innate immune response. Some viruses can block or modify various stages in the intracellular pathways for expression of signaling molecules induced by infection. These effects may be exerted in a temporal manner during the different stages of virus replication (see below). The host responds rapidly in a matter of a few hours following virus invasion. The innate defense includes (1) phagocytic cells (macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils) that engulf invading viruses, (2) natural killer (NK) cells that lyse infected cells, (3) activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that induce inflammatory mediators to stimulate the maturation of innate immune cells and their recruitment to the site of infection. This also induces the interferon response with direct antiviral activity and contributes significantly to the development of an adaptive immune response several days later, (4) small interfering RNA molecules (RNAi) that interfere with virus replication, and (5) induction of apoptosis (programmed cell death) that leads to elimination of infected cells. These cells are very much at the front line in the early host response to virus infection. Monocytes display considerable mobility and a homing capacity for sites of infection, infiltrating tissue, and thence differentiating into macrophages. Macrophages and dendritic cells occupy key locations in various tissues, for example, alveolar macrophages in the lung, Kupffer cells in the liver, and Langerhans dendritic cells in the skin. Both monocytes and macrophages are important initiators of the immune response against viral invasion. Macrophages often become the predominant cell within a focus of infection by 24 hours. Activated macrophages have increased chemotactic activity, phagocytic activity, and digestive powers. Dendritic cells carry out afferent immune functions at all body surfaces by promoting the transfer of immune signals and cells into the regional lymph nodes where together with the liver and spleen most phagocytic removal of foreign particles occurs. All three cell types bear immunoglobulin Fc and C3b receptors on their cell surface to promote the phagocytosis of immune complexes (consisting of virions coated with antibody). By serving as \"professional\" antigen-presenting cells these cells exercise a controlling influence over the Innate Immunity rapidity, magnitude, and dynamics of the immune response. Macrophages then also contribute to the efferent limb of the immune response: cytokines secreted by activated T cells bring more monocytes into the infection focus that then become differentiated into macrophages. Viruses have developed a number of ways to circumvent the extreme degradative environment of the macrophage cytoplasm. Dendritic cells infected with viruses lose endocytic capacity, allowing the virus the opportunity to migrate into distant organs and tissues, for example, HIV and Ebola virus. The Ebola virus VP35 protein (see Chapter 28: Filoviruses) blocks dendritic cell activation and effectively breaks the link between innate and adaptive immunity. A few viruses, for example, poxviruses and herpesviruses, trigger dendritic cell apoptosis, with the result of a reduced capacity of the system to present viral antigens to the adaptive immune system. NK cells are another important component of the early defense system, with the activity of these cells greatly enhanced within one to two days of viral infection. Resting NK cells are found in large quantities in the spleen, uterus, liver, and blood, but can be rapidly recruited to any site in the body in response to chemokine signaling from damaged tissue, tumor cells, and cells infected with a pathogen. The NK cell surface markers include the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM: CD56) or the low affinity IgG receptor CD16, or both. These large, non-phagocytic cells of the lymphoid system share the same lineage as mature T cells of the adaptive immune system, but differ in a number of important regards. The first is that NK cells lack T cell receptors (TCRs) but are activated by recognizing infected or tumor cells on which the density of molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC: see Chapter 6: Adaptive Immune Responses to Infection) has been reduced. Viruses downregulate surface MHC class I molecules, in order to escape recognition by CD8+ T cells. However, cells lacking class I MHC molecules are susceptible to NK cells: the so-called missing self hypothesis. This reduced MHC density on the target cell disturbs the balance between activator and inhibitory receptor signaling at the surface of the NK cell, as the inhibitory receptors recognize class I MHC molecules on the surface of healthy cells. Second, NK cells are activated by several non-antigen-specific mechanisms to produce preformed pore-inducing (perforin) and granzyme molecules that induce apoptosis in the target cell: this is in contrast to cytotoxic, CD8+ T cells of the adaptive immune response that only produce these effector molecules once activated via recognition of class I MHC molecules in association with viral peptides. The third, and most important, difference is that NK cells do not need to proliferate and differentiate into viral-specific cells before activation. Overall, NK cells, while not displaying any immunological specificity for particular viral antigens, play an essential role in defense by mediating the death of infected cells by apoptosis, and by priming the adaptive response through secretion of several cytokines including interferon γ, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), IL-4, and IL-13 ( Fig. 5.1) . Several families of viruses have developed mechanisms for evading NK responses, most notably members of the As mentioned above, an early important line of defense is the recognition of viral components by germlineencoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) capable of distinguishing viral products from those of the host. PRRs are expressed in many cell types likely to be present at portals of virus entry, including macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, NK cells, endothelial cells, and mucosal epithelial cells. These cellular receptor molecules recognize different classes of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). There are a number of classes of PRRs that are present on the majority of mammalian cells. These include the C-type lectin receptors, NOD-like receptors, the transmembrane Toll like Receptor (TLR) receptors, and the cytosolic RIG-I like receptors (RLR) such as RIG-I and MDA5. TLRs consist of amino-terminal leucine-rich repeat domains responsible for PAMP recognition and a cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domain that recognizes interleukin-1 and leads to downstream signal transduction. In contrast, the RLRs recognize associated PAMP via caspase activation and recruitment (CARD) domains. Common to both classes of PRR, the PRR-PAMP complex then triggers a series of signaling cascades, culminating in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other . Importantly, these molecules also play an important role in the development of adaptive immune responses necessary for viral clearance and sustained, long-term immunological memory. Most attention has been focused on the class of TLRs and RLRs. The TLRs were first discovered in studies of fruit flies (Drosophila spp.) and subsequently 10 homologues were found in humans. Human TLRs are classified into six major groups that recognize both bacterial and viral PAMPs (Table 5 .3). PAMPs may not necessarily be proteins and in the case of viral infection the TLRs recognize predominantly nucleic acids. One important PAMP consists of doublestranded RNA replicative intermediate structures, as will be discussed below. Although the 21 naturally occurring amino acids could theoretically assume diverse molecular structures in forming viral proteins, in reality the repertoire of secondary polypeptide folds that act as PAMPs is more limited, governed by the polar (hydrophilic) and nonpolar (hydrophobic) side chains of individual amino acids. A prime illustration is a comparison of the VP1 major capsid proteins of biologically unrelated picornaviruses: sequence alignments show little homology yet these proteins fold to give the morphology characteristic of this virus family. Of course the adaptive immune response can distinguish these amino acid differences thus enabling a virus-specific response. In 1957 Alick Isaacs and Jean Lindenmann showed that cells of the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated hens\\' eggs infected with influenza virus release a non-viral protein that protects cells in culture from infection with the same or an unrelated virus. Dubbed \"interferon,\" this discovery led in the 1980s to further research showing that interferon was in fact a large family of cell signaling molecules known as cytokines. Interferons are thus a response to the infection of any one cell, and the secreted interferon molecules induce the expression of interferon stimulatory genes (ISGs) by the surrounding cells leading to an antiviral response. The numbers of ISGs induced in the surrounding cells can number in excess of 100 (Fig. 5.2) . Interferons (IFNs) are classified into three types according to receptor usage (Table 5 .4). Type I interferons (IFN-α, IFN-β, and others) are produced by a majority of cells and play a major role in limiting the spread of virus infections; type II interferon (IFN-γ) activates macrophages, recruits leukocytes to the sites of infection, and potentiates type I interferons; while type III (IFN-λ) interferons are particularly prominent in the control of infections at mucosal surfaces, for example the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. All interferons bind to specific cell surface receptor complexes consisting of multiple polypeptide chains. Among the type I interferons, IFN-α and IFN-β have received much attention as potential therapeutics although other interferons are present in humans (IFN-ε, IFN-κ, and IFN-ω). IFN-α is used for the treatment of hepatitis B and hepatitis C as well as for the treatment of some cancers. IFN-β has been recommended for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. The IFN-λ cytokine family is composed of IFN-λ1 (previously known as IL-29), IFN-λ2 (IL-28A), IFN-λ3 (IL-28B), and IFN-λ4, all of which are coded on human chromosome 19. In contrast to IFN-α and IFN-β signaling, IFN-λ receptors are specific to melanocytes, liver cells, and epithelial cells. Indeed, IFN-λ appears to have evolved specifically to protect the epithelium from virus infection. Since the induction of ISGs in surrounding cells by IFN-λ is perhaps more prolonged than with IFN-α, it is receiving considerable attention as a potential therapeutic agent. The density of receptor molecules on hepatocytes for IFN-λ3 varies according to genotype; a link has been established between IFN-λ3 genotype and the degree of responsiveness of hepatitis C patients to treatment with commercial IFN-α. FIGURE 5.2 Pathways of action of interferons. Type I IFNs interact with IFN-(α, β, and ω) receptor 1 (IFNAR1) and IFNAR2; type II IFN interacts with IFN-γ receptor 1 (IFNGR1) and IFNGR2; type III IFNs interact with IFN-λ receptor 1 (IFNRL1; also known as IL28RA) and IL-10 receptor 2 (IL10R2; also known as IL10RB). Type II IFN-γ is an antiparallel homodimer exhibiting a twofold axis of symmetry. It binds two IFNGR1 receptor chains, assembling a complex that is stabilized by two IFNGR2 chains. These receptors are associated with two kinases from the JAK family: Janus (JAK)1 and tyrosine (TYK2) for types I and III IFNs; JAK1 and JAK2 for type II IFN. All IFN receptor chains belong to the class 2 helical cytokine receptor family, with the 200 amino acid extracellular domains usually contain the ligand binding site. IFNAR2, IFNLR1, IL10R2, IFNGR1, and IFNGR2 are classical representatives of this family, whereas IFNAR1 is atypical, as its extracellular domain is duplicated. GAS, IFN-γ-activated site; IRF9, IFN regulatory factor 9; ISGF3, IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (refers to the STAT1-STAT2-IRF9 complex); ISRE, IFN-stimulated response element; P, phosphate; STAT1/2, signal transducers and activators of transcription 1/2. Adapted from Borden, E.C., et al., 2007. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 6, 975-990 and The induction of innate responses results in the activation of intracellular pathways that often involve overlapping signaling mechanisms. For example, transcription of IFN mRNAs is controlled by several IFN regulatory factors (IRFs), which are activated by signaling pathways that themselves become activated following interaction between different PAMPs and PRRs, particularly the TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9 in the endosome but also RLRs. in the cytoplasm. The role of the transcription factor NF-κB is also critical for both IFN and inflammatory responses. Normally sequestered in the cytoplasm through attachment to an inhibitory protein, the latter is degraded once virus infection has activated the relevant pathway, allowing NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus and there activate a myriad of cytokine genes, including IFN-β. Together, the IRF systems in conjunction with NF-κB are major regulatory elements controlling inflammatory gene expression and IFN production (Fig. 5.3) . It is thought that the major site of TLR recognition occurs within endosomes, where internalized viruses are detected. This endosomal location provides some specificity for recognition of viral RNA/DNA, as cellular derived nucleic acids are not normally present within endosomes. The role of each TLR may also differ between cell types. Intracellular TLR3 is particularly important as a cytoplasmic sensor of viral nucleic acid, especially dsRNA, a replicative intermediate present in many virus-infected cells. Activation of TLR3 leads to the production of both IFN types I and III and inflammatory cytokines via the TRIF-dependent pathway (Fig. 5. 3): TLR3 agonists provide protection against many different viruses, for example HIV, coronaviruses, and hepatitis B virus. Another example of endosomal recognition is the interaction between ssRNA and TLR7 and TLR8. TLR7 signaling is particularly prominent in peripheral dendritic cells, leading to the expression of type I IFNs. Viruses entering by direct membrane fusion at the cell surface may undergo autophagy, and viral ssRNA molecules are transported to endo-lysosomes where contact can be made with TLR7. A third mechanism has been uncovered whereby exosomes containing viral RNA are transferred by cell-to-cell contact to peripheral dendritic cells. DNA viruses such as herpesviruses and poxviruses activate IFN-α production via a TLR9-dependent pathway: cooperation is required between TLR9 and TLR2 for a response to EBV and adenoviruses. The role of TLR9 in recognizing the ssDNA of parvoviruses is less clear. Also little is known regarding the role of other TLRs in responding to viral infection: although TLR2 and TLR4 sense primarily bacterial components, there is some evidence for either or both playing a role in controlling virus infection. The action of type I interferon involves its binding to interferon receptors (IFNAR1/2), which by activating further signaling cascades (JAK/Stat pathway) leads to expression FIGURE 5.3 Pathways for virus recognition and interferon induction. In dendritic cells, TLR7 and TLR8 located in endosomal compartments recognize viral ssRNA after direct infection, autophagocytic uptake of viral material from cytoplasm, or phagocytic uptake of other infected cells or vial particles. Both TLR7 and TLR8 signal through the adapter MyD88, which through interaction with the IRAK4-IRAK1-TRAF6 complex leads to phosphorylation and activation of IRF7 and subsequent IFN transcription. TLR3 located in endosomes of DCs, macrophages, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts, is activated by encountering dsRNA. Following its activation, TLR3 signals through its adapter, TRIF, which leads to activation of non-canonical IKK kinases (TBK1/ IKKε) and subsequent phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3. Nuclear factor κ B (NF-κB) is also activated by TRIF-mediated signaling through canonical IKK kinases (IKKα, β, and γ). Cytoplasmically located RIG-1 and MDA5 are expressed in most cells and recognize 5\\'ppp-containing dsRNA or long dsRNA, respectively. Both of these cytoplasmic sensors upon activation interact and signal through the mitochondrially located adapter, MAVS. This signaling pathway, analogous to that of TLR3, leads to activation of the canonical and non-canonical IKK kinases and the following nuclear translocation of NFκB and IRF3. Concurrent activation of IRF3 and NFκB in turn allows for transcription of IFN genes and its synthesis and export.

Amino Acids 38, 1283 -1299 and From MacLachlan, N.J., Dubovi, E.J., 2011 .3), with permission. of a large number of ISGs whose main function is control of viral replication and immune modulation. Those induced ISGs that contributes to the interferon-induced antiviral state are numerous. These continue to grow and include ISG15, a ubiquitin homologue that targets more than 150 proteins for degradation; MxGTPase, a hydrolyzing enzyme that affects vesicle formation and prevents virus maturation; the 2ʹ5ʹoligoadenylate synthetase pathway, which activates cellular RNAse that cleaves viral RNAs; and the protein kinase (PKR) pathway responsible for the phosphorylation of elongation initiation factor eIF-2α and which therefore inhibits protein synthesis. Death of an infected cell may be viewed as beneficial to the host if it impedes the production of progeny viruses and thus prevents further dissemination in the body. Various derangements of cell function and metabolism due to virus infection have long been recognized as causes of cell necrosis, but it is also evident that the induction of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is another mechanism whereby infected cells undergo active self-destruction. Apoptosis in the context of viral infection can be induced by one of two pathways: an intrinsic mitochondrial pathway whereby cell injury leads to increased mitochondrial permeability and leakage of mitochondrial proteins into the cytosol; or an extrinsic death domain pathway in which binding of TNF to, or interaction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes with, specific TNF cellular receptors triggers the apoptotic pathway. Once initiated by either route, the activation of host caspase enzymes degrades cellular DNA and proteins leading to cell death by apoptosis (known as the \"executioner\" phase) (Fig. 5.4) . As noted above, apoptosis of virus-infected target cells can also be initiated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells using preformed mediators such as perforin and granzyme that directly activate caspases in the target cell. Almost all viruses have developed elaborate, and often complex, strategies to circumvent host innate immunity highlighting the importance of the innate immune response; host cells have also evolved countermeasures to these evasion strategies, giving rise to a \"genetic arms race\" with both virus and host competing against the other. Viral evasion strategies include the degradation of TLR signaling components, interference with transcription factors, and mimicry of cellular proteins. Given its importance in dsRNA FIGURE 5.4 Two pathways of apoptosis. These differ as to mode of induction and regulation, but both culminate in the activation of \"executioner\" caspases that degrade cellular proteins and DNA leading to cell death. Reproduced from MacLachlan, N.J., Dubovi, E.J., 2011. Veterinary Virology, fourth ed. Academic Press (Fig. 4.5) , with permission. recognition, the TLR3 pathway is frequently targeted, with TRIF, the adaptor for TLR3, being particularly targeted for degradation by viral proteases. This targeting of TRIF is particularly effective, as TRIF abrogation also inhibits both NF-κB and IRF3 production. Other points downstream in the pathways may also be blocked: the IKK complex, for example, a complex of cellular kinases pivotal in several activation pathways, is often inhibited, as is ubiquitination, a regulatory process controlling protein turnover and cellular location. The serine protease (NS3/4A) of hepatitis C virus and the 3C protease of several picornaviruses can all cleave TRIF leading to an attenuated antiviral response, but targeting TRIF is not confined to RNA viruses. For example, TRIF levels are significantly downregulated during gamma herpesvirus infections. Interestingly, the HCV serine protease also cleaves IPS-1, an adaptor molecule within the RIG-I pathway involved in sensing viral RNA, and thus HCV can modulate PRR sensing at multiple points. For many viruses, preserving and expanding the endoplasmic reticulum of the infected cell is vital for the purpose of virus assembly and maturation while preventing stress-induced apoptosis that would otherwise be a natural consequence. Dengue viruses and other flaviviruses do this by careful control of the cellular unfolded protein response, or UPR, preventing the development of cytopathicity yet allowing for the rearrangement of cellular membrane components necessary for endoplasmic reticulum expansion. Autophagy, an important element of innate immunity, is also utilized by dengue viruses. Normally autophagosomes coalesce with lysosomes but dengue viruses inhibit this process, thus allowing these viruses to sequester within autophagosomes for the purpose of RNA replication. This complements the capacity of the virus non-structural protein NS4B to block synthesis of IFN-α and IFN-β through inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway by blocking the phosphorylation of STAT1. The result is the inhibition of interferon-inducible transmembrane protein synthesis. Mimicry of key components of innate immunity is a strategy employed by many viruses. For example, the V protein of paramyxoviruses mimics IRF3 and acts as a non-functional substrate for IRF3 kinases, thereby inhibiting pathways initiated by TLR3 binding to viral RNA. Perhaps the best studied viruses in this respect are the poxviruses: protein A49 effectively blocks through mimicry the induction of type I IFN through abolishing NF-κB activation, a key molecule for the induction of IFN gene transcription (see above and Fig. 5.2) . Following initial infection of a host cell, many host restriction factors recognize viruses and directly inhibit their replication. HIV and simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) are recognized by several host restriction factors in their respective human and non-human primate hosts. Tripartite motif-containing protein 5α (TRIM5α) is a speciesspecific host restriction factor that restricts the replication of HIV-1 in Old World monkeys such as rhesus and cynomolgus macaques. Rhesus TRIM5α restricts HIV-1 infection by interacting with the HIV-1 capsid at an early stage of infection, and is believed to be involved in the innate immune response to retroviral infection. Similarly, apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing, enzyme-catalytic, polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G) is a host protein; APOBEC3G restricts the replication of retroviruses including HIV and SIV, by converting deoxycytidine to deoxyuridine on the minus strand of viral DNA during reverse transcription, thereby introducing (often lethal) mutations into the genome. The retroviral protein viral infectivity factor (Vif) counteracts this by binding to, and assisting degradation of, APOBEC3G via a ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal pathway. Recently, a study of four African green monkey subspecies, which can be infected with divergent strains of SIV, highlighted that there is ongoing evolution of simian APOBEC3G in the absence of ongoing disease even in a non-pathogenic infection. In response to these changes, both natural isolates from long-term infected individuals and viruses from experimentally infected individuals also adapt to retarget the host restriction factor. These factors may contribute to the narrow species specificity of closely related retroviruses, and highlight the ongoing conflict between virus and host. In another example, the transmembrane protein tetherin inhibits the detachment of enveloped viruses from the cell membrane; in the case of HIV, the viral protein U (Vpu) counteracts this by degrading and downregulating tetherin, thereby enhancing virus release. This action of Vpu also helps to protect cells from elimination by antibodydependent cell cytotoxicity. Vpu also acts to enhance the degradation of newly formed CD4 molecules.',\n",

Special attention has been paid to bat coronaviruses as the two emerging coronaviruses which have caused unexpected human disease outbreaks in the 21st century, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), are suggested to be originated from bats. Various species of horseshoe bats in China have been found to harbor genetically diverse SARS-like coronaviruses. Some strains are highly similar to SARS-CoV even in the spike protein and are able to use the same receptor as SARS-CoV for cell entry. On the other hand, diverse coronaviruses phylogenetically related to MERS-CoV have been discovered worldwide in a wide range of bat species, some of which can be classified to the same coronavirus species as MERS-CoV. Coronaviruses genetically related to human coronavirus 229E and NL63 have been detected in bats as well. Moreover, intermediate hosts are believed to play an important role in the transmission and emergence of these coronaviruses from bats to humans. Understanding the bat origin of human coronaviruses is helpful for the prediction and prevention of another pandemic emergence in the future. Bats, with extensive geographical distribution and capability of flight, constitute the second largest group of mammalian species and have been documented as natural hosts of a large number of diverse viruses such as lyssaviruses, paramyxoviruses and filoviruses [1, 2] . In the past decade, numerous novel coronaviruses have been discovered in a wide variety of bat species throughout Asia, Europe, Africa and America [3] . Within the coronavirus genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus, which mainly infect mammals, 7 out of the 15 currently assigned viral species have only been found in bats [4] . It is proposed that bats are major hosts for alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses and play an '"

              "'Autophagy is a degradative transport route conserved among all eukaryotic organisms. During starvation, cytoplasmic components are randomly sequestered into large double‐membrane vesicles called autophagosomes and delivered into the lysosome/vacuole where they are destroyed. Cells are able to modulate autophagy in response to their needs, and under certain circumstances, cargoes, such as aberrant protein aggregates, organelles, and bacteria can be selectively and exclusively incorporated into autophagosomes. As a result, this pathway plays an active role in many physiological processes, and it is induced in numerous pathological situations because of its ability to rapidly eliminate unwanted structures. Despite the advances in understanding the functions of autophagy and the identification of several factors, named Atg proteins that mediate it, the mechanism that leads to autophagosome formation is still a mystery. A major challenge in unveiling this process arises from the fact that the origin and the transport mode of the lipids employed to compose these structures is unknown. This compendium will review and analyze the current data about the possible membrane source(s) with a particular emphasis on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the leading model organism for the study of autophagosome biogenesis, and on mammalian cells. The information acquired investigating the pathogens that subvert autophagy in order to replicate in the host cells will also be discussed because it could provide important hints for solving this mystery. In eukaryotic cells, the principal locations where protein catabolism occurs are the proteasome and the lysosome. The proteasome mostly recognizes and degrades cytosolic factors that have been specifically marked with polyubiquitin chains (Roos-Mattjus and Sistonen, 2004) . The lysosome in contrast, requires active transport in order for the diVerent substrates destined for elimination to reach its interior where the proteases are located. Four diVerent pathways can deliver intracellular proteins into the lysosome lumen: endosomal transport routes, chaperone-mediated '"

        "con = \"COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that emerged from Wuhan, China in December 2019, and within 3 months became a global pandemic. AREAS COVERED: PubMed search of published data on COVID-19, respiratory infections, and diabetes mellitus (DM). DM associates with impairments of both cellular and humoral immunity. Early emergent global data reveal that severity of clinical outcome from COVID-19 infection (including hospitalization and admission to Intensive Care Unit [ICU]), associate with co-morbidities, prominently DM. The key principles of management of COVID-19 in patients with DM include ongoing focused outpatient management (remotely where necessary) and maintenance of good glycemic control. EXPERT OPINION: We will remember the dawn of the third decade of the twenty-first century as a time when the world changed, the true scale and impact of which is hard for us to imagine. Like a phoenix from the ashes though, COVID-19 provides us with a great learning opportunity to renew insights into ourselves as individuals, our clinical teams, and the optimized provision of care for our patients. COVID-19 has re-shaped and re-focused our collective societal values, with a sea-changed shift from materialistic to human-centric, from self-centredness to altruism, ultimately for the betterment of patient care and the whole of society.\""
